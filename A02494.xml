            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Maruaile not a little (right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull) that ſince the firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of America (which is nowe full foureſcore and tenne yeeres) after ſo great conqueſts and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Spaniardes and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingales there, that wee of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande could neuer haue the grace to ſet faſt footing in ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and temperate places, as are left as yet vnpoſſeſſed of them. But againe when I conſider that there is a time for all men, and ſee the Portingales time to be out of date, &amp; that the nakedneſſe of the ſpaniards, and their long hidden ſecretes are nowe at length eſpied, whereby they went about to delude the worlde, I conceiue great hope, that the time approcheth and nowe is, that we of England may ſhare and part ſtakes (if wee will our ſelues) both with the ſpaniarde and the Portingale in part of America, and other regions as yet vndiſcouered. And ſurely if there were in vs that deſire to aduaunce the honour of our Countrie which ought to bee in euery good man, wee woulde not all this while haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlowne the poſſeſſing of thoſe landes, whiche of equitie and right appertaine vnto vs, as by the diſcourſes that followe ſhall appeare moſt plainely. Yea if wee woulde beholde with the eye of pitie howe al our Priſons are peſtered and filled with able men to ſerue their Countrie, which for ſmall roberies are dayly hanged vp in great numbers euen twentie at a clappe out of one iayle (as was ſeene at the laſt aſſiſes at Rocheſter) wee woulde haſten and further euery man to his power the deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſome Colonies of our ſuperfluous people into thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and fertile partes of America, which being within ſixe
<pb facs="tcp:6277:4"/> weekes ſayling of England are yet vnpoſſeſſed by any Chriſtians: and ſeeme to offer themſelues vnto vs, ſtretching neerer vnto her Maieſties Dominions, then to any other part of Europe. Wee reade that the Bees, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they grow to be too many in their own hiues at home, are wont to bee led out by their Captaines to ſwarme abroad, and ſeeke themſelues a new dwelling place. If the examples of the Grecians and Carthaginians of olde time, and the practiſe of our age may not mooue vs, yet let vs learne wiſdome of theſe ſmal weake and vnreaſonable creatures. It chaunced very lately that vpon occaſion I had great conference in matters of Coſmographie with an excellent learned man of Portingale, moſt priuie to all the diſcoueries of his nation, who wondered that thoſe bleſſed countries, from the point of Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da Northward,<note place="margin">The ſpeech of a learned Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale.</note> were all this while vnplanted by Chriſtians, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting with great affection and zeale, that if hee were nowe as young as I (for at this preſent hee is threeſcore yeeres of age) hee woulde ſel all hee had, being a man of no ſmall wealth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to furniſh a conuenient number of ſhips to ſea for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting of thoſe countries, and reducing thoſe gentile people to chriſtianitie.<note place="margin">Maſter Iohn Barros the cauſer of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting of Breſilia.</note> Moreouer hee added that Iohn Barros their chiefe Coſmographer being moued with the like deſire, was the cauſe that Breſilia was firſt inhabited by the Portingales: where they haue nine baronies or lordſhips, &amp; thirtie engennies or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger milles, two or three hundred ſlaues belonging to eche myll, with a Iudge, and other officers, &amp; a Church: ſo that euery mill is as it were a little common wealth: and that the countrie was firſt planted by ſuch men, as for ſmall offences were ſaued from the rope. This hee ſpake not onely vnto mee and in my hearing, but alſo in the preſence of a friend of mine, a man of great ſkill in the Mathematikes. If this mans deſire might bee executed, wee might not only for the preſent time take poſſeſsion of that good land, but alſo in ſhort ſpace by Gods grace finde out that ſhorte and eaſie paſſage by the Northweſt, which we haue hetherto ſo long deſired, and whereof wee haue many good and more then probable coniectures: a fewe whereof I thinke it not amiſſe heere to ſet downe, although your worſhip knowe them as
<pb facs="tcp:6277:4"/> well as my ſelfe. Firſt therefore it is not to bee forgotten, that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian Gabot wrote to maſter Baptiſta Ramuſius, that he very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeued that all the North part of America is diuided into I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes. Secondly that maſter Iohn Verarzanus, which had been thriſe on that coaſt, in an olde excellent mappe, which he gaue to king Henrie the eight, and is yet in the cuſtodie of maſter Locke, doth ſo lay it out, as it is to bee ſeene in the mappe annexed to the end of this boke, beeing made according to Verarzanus plat. Thirdly the ſtory of Gil Gonſalua recorded by Franciſcus Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes de Gomara, which is ſaide to haue ſought a paſſage by the North weſt, ſeemeth to argue and proue the ſame. Fourthly, in the ſecond relation of Iaques Cartier the 12. Chapter the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Saguinay doe teſtifie that vpon their coaſtes Weſtwarde there is a ſea the ende whereof is vnknowne vnto them. Fiftly, in the end of that diſcourſe is added this, as a ſpecial remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, to wit, that they of Canada ſay that it is a monethes ſpace to ſaile to a lande where cinamon and cloues are growing. Sixtly, the people of Florida ſignified vnto Iohn Ribault (as it is expreſſed in his diſcourſe heerewithall imprinted) that they might ſaile from the Riuer of May vnto Ceuola and the ſouth ſea through their countrie within twentie dayes. Seuenthly, the experience of captaine. Frobiſher on the hyther ſide, and Sir Fraunces Drake on the backe ſide of America, with the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Nicolaus and Anthonius Zeni, that Eſtotilanda is an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, doth yeelde no ſmall hope thereof. Laſtly, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the excellent Geographer Gerardus Mercator, which his ſonne Rumold Mercator my friende ſhewed mee in his letters, &amp; drewe out for mee in writing, is not of wiſe men lightly to bee regarded. His words are theſe.<note place="margin">The iudgement of Gerardus Mercator of a paſſage by the Northweſt.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:6277:5"/> of Frobiſher, which I wonder was neuer theſe many yeeres heeretofore attempted. For there is no doubt, but that there is a ſtraight and ſhort way open into the Weſt euen vnto Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thay. Into which kingdome, if they take their courſe aright, they ſhall gather the moſt noble merchandiſe of all the worlde, and ſhall make the name of Chriſte to bee knowne vnto many idolatrous and Heathen people. And heere to conclude and ſhut vp this matter, I haue hearde my ſelfe of Merchants of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite that haue liued long in Spaine, that King Phillip hath made a lawe of late that none of his ſubiectes ſhall diſcouer to the Northwardes of fiue and fortie degrees of America:<note place="margin">A lawe made of late by king. Phillip.</note> whiche may bee thought to proceede chiefly of two cauſes, the one, leaſt paſsing farther to the North they ſhould diſcouer the open paſſage from the ſouth ſea to our north ſea: the other becauſe they haue not people enough to poſſeſſe and keepe that paſſage, but rather thereby ſhoulde open a gappe for other nations to paſſe that way. Certes if hetherto in our owne diſcoueries we had not beene led with a prepoſterous deſire of ſeeking ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaine then Gods glorie, I aſſure my ſelf that our labours had taken farre better effecte. But wee forgotte, that Godlineſſe is great riches, and that if we firſt ſeeke the kingdome of God, al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges will be giuen vnto vs, and that as the light accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the Sunne, and the heate the fire, ſo laſting riches do waite vpon them that are zealous for the aduauncement of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, and the enlargement of his glorious Goſpell: as it is ſayde, I will honour them that honour mee. I truſte that nowe being taught by their manifolde loſſes our men will take a more godly courſe, and vſe ſome part of their goods to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: if not, he will turne euen their couetouſnes to ſerue him, as he hath done the pride and auarice of the Spaniardes and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingales, who pretending in glorious words that they made their diſcoueries chiefly to conuert Infidelles to our moſt holy faith, (as they ſay) in deed and truth ſought not them, but their goods and riches. Whiche thing that our nation may more ſpeedily &amp; happily performe, there is no better meane in my ſimple iudge me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then the increaſe of knowledge in the arte of nauigation, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:6277:5"/> breading of ſkilfulneſſe in the ſea men: whiche Charles the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the king of Spaine that nowe is wiſely conſidering haue in their Contractation houſe in Siuill<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tractatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> houſe at Siuill.</note> appointed a learned reader of the ſayde art of Nauigation, and ioyned with him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne examiners, and haue diſtinguiſhed the orders among the ſea men, as the groomet whiche is the baſeſt degree, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner which is the ſeconde, the maſter the thirde, and the pilote the fourth, vnto the which two laſt degrees none is admitted without hee haue heard the reader for a certaine ſpace (which is commonly an excellent Mathematician, of which number were Pedro di Medina which writte learnedly of the art of nauigation, and Alonſo di Chauez &amp; Hieronimus di Chauez, whoſe works likewiſe I haue ſeene) and being founde fitte by him and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtantes, which are to examine matters touching experience, they are admitted with as great ſolemnitie and giuing of preſents to the ancient maſters and Pilots, and the reader and examiners, as the great doctors in the Vniuerſities, or our great Sergeantes at the law when they proceed, and ſo are admitted to take charge for the Indies. And that your worſhippe may knowe that this is true, Maſter Steuen Borrows,<note place="margin">M. Steuen Borrowes.</note> nowe one of the foure maſters of the Queenes nauie, tolde me that newely after his returne from the diſcouery of Moſcouie by the North, in Queene Maries daies, the Spaniards, hauing intelligence that he was maſter in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie, tooke him into their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tractation houſe at their making and admitting of maſters and pilots, giuing him great honour, &amp; preſented him with a payre of perfumed gloues woorth fiue or ſixe Ducates. I ſpeake all this to this ende, that the like order of erecting ſuch a Lecture<note place="margin">A lecture of the art of nauigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſarie for to be erected in London.</note> here in London or about Ratcliffe in ſome conuenient place, were a matter of great conſequence and importance, for the ſauing of many mens liues and goods, which nowe through groſſe ignorance are dayly in great hazerd, to the no ſmall detriment of the whole realme. For whiche cauſe I haue dealt with the right worſhipfull ſir Frances Drake, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God hath bleſſed him ſo wonderfully, he woulde do this hon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour to him ſelfe and benefite to his countrey, to bee at the coſt to erecte ſuch a lecture: Whereunto in moſt bountifull maner
<pb facs="tcp:6277:6"/> at the verie firſt he anſwered,<note place="margin">The bountiful offer of ſir Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Drake to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward furthering the art of Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> that he liked ſo well of the motion, that he woulde giue twentie poundes by the yeere ſtanding, and twentie poundes more before hand to a learned man to furniſh him with inſtruments and maps, that woulde take this thing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: yea ſo readie he was that he earneſtly requeſted mee to helpe him to the notice of a fitte man for that purpoſe, which I, for the zeale I bare to this good actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did preſently, &amp; brought him one, who came vnto him &amp; conferred with him thereupon: but in fine he would not vndertake the lecture, vnleſſe he might haue fourtie pounde a yeere ſtanding, and ſo the matter ceaſed for that time: howebeit the worthie and good Knight remaineth full conſtant, and will be, as he told me very lately, as good as his worde. Nowe if God ſhoulde put into the head of any noble man to contribute other twentie pounde, to make this lecture a competent liuing for a learned man, the whole realme no doubt might reape no ſmall benefite thereby. To leaue this matter &amp; to drawe to an ende, I haue heare right worſhipfull in this haſtie worke firſt put downe the title which we haue to that part of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica which is from Florida to 67. degrees northwarde, by the letters patentes graunted to Iohn Gabote and his three ſonnes,<note place="margin">Ihon Gabote and his three ſonnes.</note> Lewes, Sebaſtian, and Santius, with Sebaſtians owne Certificate to Baptiſta Ramuſius of his diſcouerie of America, and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Fabian our own Chronicler. Next I haue cauſed to bee added the letters of M. Robert Thorne to King Henrie the eight, and his diſcourſe to his Ambaſſadour doctor Ley in Spaine of the like argument, with the kings ſetting out of two ſhips for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie in the 19. yere of his raigne. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue tranſlated the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Iohn Verarzanus from thirtie degrees to Cape Briton, (&amp; the laſt yeere at my charges, and other of my friendes by my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, I cauſed Iaques Cartiers two voyages of diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the grand Bay, and Canada, Saguinay, and Hochelaga to bee tranſlated out of my Volumes, which are to be annexed to this preſent tranſlation). Moreouer following the order of the map, and not the courſe of time, I haue put downe the diſcourſe of Nicholaus and Antonius Zenie. The laſt treatiſe of Iohn Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bault, is a thing that hath been alreadie printed, but not nowe to

<pb facs="tcp:6277:12"/> which hitherto as I ſuppoſe hath beene hid:<note place="margin">Note.</note> which is that with a ſmall number of ſhippes there may bee diſcouered diuers newe landes and kingdomes, in the whiche without doubt your Grace ſhall winne perpetuall glory and your Subiects infinite profite. To which places there is left one way to diſcouer, which is into the North: For that of the foure parts of the worlde it ſeemeth three partes are diſcouered by other Princes. For out of Spaine they haue diſcouered all the Indies and Seas Occidentall, and out of Portugale all the Indies and Seas Oriental: So that by this part of the Orient and Occident, they haue compaſſed the worlde. For the one of them departing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the Orient, and the other towarde the Occident, met againe in the courſe or way of the middeſt of the day, and ſo then was diſcouered a great part of the ſame Seas and coaſtes by the Spaniardes. So that nowe reſt to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the ſaide North partes, the which it ſeemeth to mee, is onely your charge and duetie. Becauſe the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of this your Realme is thereunto neereſt and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all other:<note place="margin">Note.</note> and alſo for that you haue alreadie taken it in hande: And in mine opinion, it will not ſeeme well to leaue ſo great and profitable an enterpriſe, ſeeing it may ſo eaſily and with ſo little coſte, labour, and daunger, bee followed and obteined: Though heeretofore your Grace hath made theereof a proofe, and founde not the commoditie thereby as you truſted, at this time it ſhall bee no impediment. For there may bee nowe prouided remedies for thinges, then lacked, and the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and lettes remooued that then were cauſe your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſire tooke no full effect, which is, the courſes to be chaunged, and followe the aforeſaid new courſes. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the marriners, ſhippes, and prouiſion, an order may be deuiſed and taken meete and conuenient much better then hetherto. By reaſon whereof, and by Gods grace, no doubt your purpoſe ſhall take effect. Surely the coſte heerein will bee nothing, in compariſon to the great profite.
<pb facs="tcp:6277:13"/> The labour is much leſſe, yea nothing at all, where ſo great honour and glory is hoped for: and conſidering well the courſes, truly the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger &amp; way is ſhorter to vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpaine or Portugall, as by euident reaſons appeareth. And nowe to declare ſome thing of the commoditie and vtilitie of this Nauigation and diſcouering,<note place="margin">Note.</note> it is very cleere and certaine, that the Seas that commonly men ſay, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great danger, difficultie and perill, yea rather it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to paſſe, thoſe ſame Seas bee nauigable and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch daunger, but that ſhippes may paſſe and haue in them perpetuall cleereneſſe of the day without any dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the night: which thing is a great commoditie for the nauigants, to ſee at all tunes rounde about them, as well the ſafegardes as daungers, and howe great difference it is betweene the commoditie and perilles of other which leaſe the moſt parte of euery foure and twentie houres the ſaide light, and goe in darkeneſſe groping their way, I thincke there is none ſo ignorant but perceiueth this more plainely, then it can bee expreſſed: yea what a vantage ſhall your Graces Subiects haue alſo by this light to diſcouer the ſtrange landes, countries, and coaſtes, for if they that bee diſcouered to ſayle by them in darkeneſſe is with great danger, muche more then the coaſtes not diſcouered be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to trauell by night or in darkeneſſe. Yet theſe dangers or darkneſſe hath not letted the Spaniardes and Portingals and other, to diſcouer many vnknowen realmes to their great perill, which conſidered (and that your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Subiectes maye haue the ſaide lighte) it will ſeeme your Graces ſubiects to bee without actiuitie or courage, in leauing to doe this glorious and noble enterpriſe. For they being paſt this little way which they named ſo dangerous, which may bee ii, or iii. leagues before they come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pole, and as much more after they paſſe the Pole, it is cleere that from thence foorth the Seas and landes are as temperat as in theſe partes, &amp; that then it may be at the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the marriners, to chooſe whether they will ſaile by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6277:13"/> coaſtes that bee colde, temperate, or hot. For they being paſt the pole, it is plaine they maye decline to what parte they liſt. If they will goe towarde the Orient they ſhall inioy the regions of all the Tartarians that extende towarde the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and from thence they may goe and proceede to the lande of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chinas, &amp; from thence to the lande of Cathaio oriental, which is of all the mayne lande moſt orientall that can bee reckoned from our habitation. And if from thence they doe continue their nauigation, following the coaſte that returns towarde the occident, they ſhall fall in Melaſſa, and ſo in all the Indees which we call orientall, and following that way may returne hither by the Cape of <hi>Bona Speranſa:</hi> and thus they ſhall compaſſe the whole worlde. And if they will take their courſe after they be paſt the pole, towarde the occident, they ſhall goe in the backe ſide of the new found lande, which of late was diſcouered by your Graces ſubiectes, vntill they come to the backſide and South ſeas of the Indees occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentalls. And ſo continuing their viage they may returne thorowe the ſtraite of <hi>Magallanas</hi> to this countrey, and ſo they compaſſe alſo the worlde by that way, and if they goe this thirde way, and after they bee paſt the pole, goe right to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the pole Antartike, and then decline toward the lands and Ilands ſituated betweene the Tropikes, and vnder the Equinoctial, without doubt they ſhal find there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> richeſt la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and Ilands of the worlde of Golde, precious ſtones, balmes, ſpices, and other thinges that wee here eſteeme moſt: which come out of ſtrang countreys, &amp; may returne the ſame way.</p>
            <p>By this it appeareth your Grace haue not onely a greate aduantage of the riches, but alſo your ſubiectes ſhall not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell halfe of the way that other doe, which goe rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as aforeſaide.</p>

For ſuch things haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times happened in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>Alſo to write to your Lordſhippe of the newe trade of ſpicerie of the Emperour, there is no doubt but that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes are fertile of cloues, nutmegs, mace, and cinnamon: And that the ſaide Ilandes, with other there about, abounde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gold, Rubies, Diamonds, Balaſſes, Granates, iacincts &amp; other ſtones &amp; pearles, as al other la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, that are vnder &amp; nere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> equinoctial. For we ſee, where nature giueth any thing, ſhe is no nigarde. For as with vs and other, that are aparted from the ſayde equinoctiall, our mettalles be lead, tynne, and yron, ſo theirs be golde, ſiluer, and copper. And as our fruites and graines be aples, nuttes, and corne, ſo theirs bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ates, nutmegges, pepper, cloues, and other ſpices. And as
<pb facs="tcp:6277:14"/> wee haue iette, amber, criſtall, iaſper, and other like ſtones, ſo haue they rubies, diamonds, balaſſes, ſaphires, Iacincts, and other like. And though ſome ſay that of ſuch precious mettals, graines or kind of ſpices, and precious ſtones, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance and quantitie is nothing ſo great, as our mettals, fruites or ſtones aboue rehearſed: yet if it be well conſidered, how the quantitie of the earth vnder the equinoctiall to both the tropicall lines, (in which ſpace is founde the ſaid golde, ſpices and precious ſtones) to be as much in quantitie, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the earth from the tropickes to both the poles: it can not be denied but there is more quantitie of the ſaid mettels, fruites, ſpices, and precious ſtones, then there is of the other mettels and other thinges before rehearſed. And I ſee that the preciouſneſſe of theſe thinges is meaſured after the diſtance that is betweene vs, and the things that we haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite vnto. For in this nauigation of the ſpicerie was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, that theſe Ilandes nothing ſet by golde, but ſet more by a knife and a nayle of yron, then by his quantitie of Golde: and with reaſon, as the thing more neceſſarie for mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. And I doubt not but to them ſhoulde bee as precious our corne and ſeedes, if they might haue them, as to vs their ſpices: and likewiſe the peeces of glaſſe that heare wee haue counterfayted are as precious to them, as to vs their ſtones: which by experience is ſeene daylie by them that haue trade thither. This of the riches of thoſe countries is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Touching that your Lordſhip wrote, whether it may be profitable to the Emperour or no, it may be without doubte of great profit: if as the king of Portingall doth, he woulde become a marchant, and prouide ſhippes and their lading, and trade thither alone, and defende the trade of theſe Ilands for himſelfe. But other greater buſines withholdeth him from this. But ſtill, as nowe it is begunne to bee occupied, it would come to much. For the ſhips comming in ſafetie, there would thither many euery yeere, of whiche to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is due of all the wares and Iuelles that come from
<pb facs="tcp:6277:15"/> thence the fift part for his cuſtome cleare without any coſt. And beſides this he putteth in euery flote a certayn quantitie of money, of whiche hee enioyeth of the gaines pounde and poundes like as other aduenturers doe. In a flote of three ſhippes and a carauell that went from this citie armed by the marchauntes of it, which departed in Aprill laſt paſt, I and my partener haue <hi>1400.</hi> Ducates that we employed in the ſayde fleete,<note place="margin">Note.</note> principally for that two Engliſhmen friends of mine, whiche are ſomewhat learned in Coſmographie, ſhoulde goe in the ſame ſhippes, to bring mee certaine relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſituation of the countrey, and to bee experte in the Nauigation of thoſe ſeas, and there to haue informations of many other things, and aduiſe that I deſire to know eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.

And to aduiſe your Lordſhippe whether of theſe ſpice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the King of Portingal or the Emperours is neerer, and alſo of the titles that eyther of them hath, and howe our Newe founde landes are parted from it, (for that by writyng without ſome demonſtration, it were harde to giue any declaration of it,) I haue cauſed that your Lorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe ſhall receyue herewith a little Mappe or Carde of the worlde: the whiche, I feare mee, ſhall put your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe to more labour to vnderſtande, then mee to make it, only for that it is made in ſo little roome that it cannot be but obſcurely ſet out, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is deſired to be ſeene in it, &amp; alſo for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am in this ſcience litle expert: Yet to remedy in part this

            <p>Firſt, your Lordſhip knoweth that the Coſmographers haue deuided the earth by <hi>360.</hi> degrees in latitude, and as many in longitude, vnder the which is comprehended al the roundneſſe of the earth: the latitude beeing deuided into <hi>4.</hi> quarters, ninetie degrees amount to euerie quarter, which they meaſure by the altitude of the poles, that is the North and South ſtarres, beeing from the line equinoctiall till they come right vnder the Noth ſtarre the ſaide ninetie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: and aſmuche from the ſayde line equinoctiall to the South ſtarre bee other ninetie degrees. And aſmuche more is alſo from eyther of the ſaide ſtarres agayne to the equinoctiall. Which imagined to be rounde, is ſoone perceiued thus, <hi>360.</hi> degrees of latitude to be conſumed in the ſaid foure quarters, of ninetie degrees a quarter, ſo that this latitude is the meaſure of the worlde from North to South, and from South to North. And the longitude, in which are alſo counted other <hi>360.</hi> is counted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Weſt to Eaſt, or from Eaſt to Weſt, as in the card is ſet. The ſaid latitude your Lordſhip may ſee marked and deuided in the end of this carde on the left hande.<note place="margin">To know the latitudes.</note> So that if you woulde know in what degrees of latitude any region or coaſt ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, take a compaſſe and ſet the one foote of the ſame in the equinoctiall line right againſt the ſaid region, and apply the other foote of the compaſſe to the ſaide region or coaſt, and then ſet the ſayd compaſſe at the ende of the carde, where the degrees are deuided. And the one foote of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the line equinoctiall, the other will ſhewe in the ſcale the degrees of altitude or latitude that the ſayd region is in. Alſo the longitude of the worlde I haue ſet out in the nether part of the carde, contayning alſo <hi>360.</hi> degrees: which begin to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted after Ptolome and other Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers from an head land called <hi>Capo verde,</hi> which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer againſt a little croſſe made in the part occidentall, where
<pb facs="tcp:6277:16"/> the diuiſion of the degrees beginneth, &amp; endeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po verde.</hi>
               <note place="margin">To knowe the Longitudes.</note> Nowe to knowe in what longitude any lande is, your Lordeſhippe muſt take a ruler or a compaſſe, and ſet the one foote of the compaſſe vpon the lande or coaſt whoſe longitude you woulde knowe, and extende the other foote of the compaſſe to the nexte parte of one of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall lines in the Orientall or Occidentall part: which done, ſet the one foote of the compaſſe in the ſaide tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall lyne at the ende of the nether ſcale, the ſcale of longitude, and the other foote ſheweth the degree of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude that the region is in. And your Lordſhippe muſt vnderſtande that this carde though little conteyneth the vniuerſall whole worlde betwixte the twoo collaterall lines, the one in the Occidentall parte deſcendeth perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular vppon the <hi>175.</hi> degree, and the other in the Orientall on the <hi>170.</hi> degree, whoſe diſtaunce meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſcale of longitude. And that whiche is without the two ſayde tranſuerſall lynes is onely to ſhew howe the Oriental part is ioyned with the Occident, &amp; Occident with the Orient. For that that is ſet without the line in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parte, is the ſame that is ſet within the other line in the Occidentall parte: and againe that that is ſette without the line in the Occidentall part, is the ſame that is ſet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the line on the Orientall parte: To ſhewe that though this figure of the worlde in playne or flat ſeemeth to haue an ende, yet one imagining that this ſayde carde were ſet vpon a round thing, where the endes ſhoulde touche by the lines, it would plainely appeare howe the Orient part ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with the Occident, as there without the lines it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed &amp; figured. And for more declaration of the ſaid card, your Lordſhip ſhall vnderſtand, that beginning on the parte Occidentall within the lyne, the firſt land that is ſet out, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mayne land &amp; Iland of the Indies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour. Which mayne lande or coaſt goeth Northwarde, and finiſheth in the lande that wee founde, whiche is called heere <hi>Terra de Labrador.</hi> So that it appeareth the ſayde lande that wee founde and the Indies to bee all one mayne lande. The

The firſt lande from the ſayd beginning of the carde towarde the Orient is certaine Ilandes of the Canaries &amp; Ilandes of <hi>Capo verde.</hi> But the firſt mayne lande next to the line Equinoctiall is the ſayde <hi>Capo verde,</hi> and from thence northwarde by the ſtreite of this ſea of Italie. And ſo followeth Spayne, Fraunce, Flaunders, Almaine, Denmarke and Norway, which is the higheſt parte tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the North. And ouer againſt Flaunders are our Ilands of England and Irelande. Of the landes and coaſtes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſtraites I haue ſet out onelye the Regions, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them by lynes of their lymittes, by whiche playnelie I thinke your Lordſhip may ſee, in what ſituatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, and of what highneſſe, &amp; with what regions it is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. I doe thinke few are lefte out of all Europe. In the partes of Aſia and Affrica I could not ſo well make the ſaid diuiſions: for that they be not ſo well knowen, nor neede not ſo muche. This I write becauſe in the ſayde carde bee made the ſayde lynes and ſtrikes, that your Lordſhippe ſhould vnderſtande wherefore they doe ſerue. Alſo returning to foreſayde <hi>Capo verde</hi> the coaſt goeth Southwarde to a cape called <hi>Capo de bona ſperanſa:</hi> which is right ouer agaynſt the ſixtye and ſixtie fifte degree of Longitude. And by this cape goe the Portingales to their ſpicerie. For from this cape towarde the Orient, is the Lande of <hi>Calicut,</hi> as your Lordſhippe may ſee in the head lande o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer againſt the <hi>130.</hi> degree. From the ſaid cape of <hi>Bona Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ransa</hi> the coaſt returneth toward the line Equinoctiall, and paſſing foorth entreth the read ſea, &amp; returning out entreth againe into the gulfe of Perſia, and returneth towarde the Equinoctiall line, till that it commeth to the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb facs="tcp:6277:17"/> called Callicut afore ſaide, and from thence the coaſt making a Gulfe, where is the riuer of Ganges, returneth towarde the line to a head lande called Malacha, where is the principall ſpicerie: And from this cape returneth and maketh a great gulfe, and after the coaſt goeth right toward the Orient, and ouer againſt this laſt gulfe and coaſt be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Ilandes, which be Ilandes of the ſpiceries of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Vpon which the Portingales and he be at vartaunce. The ſaid coaſt goeth towarde the Orient, and endeth right againſt the <hi>155.</hi> degrees, and after returneth toward the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident Northwarde: which coaſt not yet plainely knowne I may ioyn to the new found land found by vs, that I ſpake of before. So that I finiſhe with this a briefe declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the carde aforeſayde. Well I knowe I ſhoulde alſo haue declared how the coaſtes within the ſtreites of the Sea of Italie runne. It is plaine that paſſing the ſtreites on the Northſide of that Sea after the coaſt of Granado, and with that which pertaynes to Spayne, is the coaſt of that which Fraunce hath in Italie. And then followeth in one peece all Italie, which lande hath an arme of a ſea with a gulfe which is called <hi>Mare Adriaticum.</hi> And in the bottome of this gulfe is the citie of Venice. And on the other part of the ſaid gulfe is Sclauonia, and nexte Grecia, then the ſtreites of Conſtantinople, and then the Sea called <hi>Euximus,</hi> which is within the ſaide ſtreites: And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the ſaid ſtraits floweth toward Turcia ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior. (Though now on both ſides it is called Turcia.) And ſo the coaſt runneth Southward to Syria, and ouer againſt the ſaid Turcia are the Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of Rhodes, Candie, and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus. And ouer againſt Italie are the Ilandes of Sicilia &amp; Sardinia. And ouer againſt Spaine is Maiorca and minor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. In the ende of the gulfe of Syria is Iudea. And from thence returneth the coaſt toward the Occident, till it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the ſtreites where wee beganne, whiche all is the coaſt of Affricke or Barbarie. Alſo your Lordſhippe ſhall vnderſtande that the coaſtes of the Sea throughout all the world I haue coloured with yellow; for that it may appeare
<pb facs="tcp:6277:17"/> that all that is within the line coloured yellow, is to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be mayne land or Iland: and all without the ſayde line ſo coloured to bee Sea: whereby it is eaſie and light to know it. Albeit in this little roome any other deſcription would rather haue made it obſcure then cleere. Alſo the ſayd coaſts of the Sea are all ſet iuſtly after the manner &amp; forme as they lye, as the nauigation approoueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> throughout all the carde, ſaue onely the coaſtes and Iles of the ſpicerie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour which is from ouer againſt the <hi>160.</hi> to the <hi>215.</hi> degrees of Longitude. For theſe coaſtes &amp; ſituations of the Ilands euery of the Coſinographers and pilots of Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and Spayne doe ſet after their purpoſe. The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards more towards the Orient, becauſe they ſhould appeare to appertaine to the Emperour: and the Portingalles more toward the Occident, for that they ſhould fall within their iuriſdiction. So that the Pilots &amp; nauigants thither, which in ſuch caſes ſhould declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, by their induſtrie doe ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſely euery one to fauour his prince. And for this cauſe can be no certaine ſituatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coaſt &amp; Ilands, til this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixte them be verified. Nowe to come to the purpoſe of your Lordſhippes demaunde touching the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the Emperour and the king of Portingall, to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it better, I muſt declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering. Though peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture your Lordſhip may ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in that I haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought of purpoſe I fall in the Prouerbe, <hi>A gemino ouo bellum:</hi> But your Lordſhip commaunded me to be large, &amp; I take licence to be prolixouſe, &amp; ſhalbe perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture tedious, but your Lordſhip knoweth that <hi>nihil igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia verboſius.</hi> In the yeere <hi>1484.</hi> the king of Portingal minded to arme certaine caruelles to diſcouer this ſpicery. Then foraſmuch as he feared that being diſcouered euerie other prince would ſend &amp; trade thither, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the coſt &amp; peril of diſcouering ſhould be his, &amp; the profite common: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt he gaue knowledge of this his mynd to al princes chriſtened, ſaying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would ſeeke amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infidels newe poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of regions, &amp; therfore would make a certain army: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would help in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid army he ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:6277:18"/> enioy his parte of the profite or honour that ſhoulde come of it. And as then this diſcouering was holden for a ſtraunge thing and vncertaine. Nowe they ſay, that all the Princes of Chriſtendome aunſweared that they woulde bee no part of ſuch an army, nor yet of the profite y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might come of it. After the which he gaue knowledge to the Pope of his purpoſe, &amp; of the anſwere of all the Princes, deſiring him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeeing that none would helpe in the coſtes, that hee woulde iudge all that ſhoulde bee founde and diſcouered to be of his iuriſdiction, and commaund that none other Princes ſhould intermeddle therewith. The Pope ſaide not as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Quis me conſtituit iudicem inter vos?</hi> He did not refuſe, but making him ſelfe as Lorde and Iudge of all, not only grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that all that ſhould be diſcouered from Orie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Occide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhould be the kings of Portingall, but alſo, that vpon great cenſures no other Prince ſhould diſcouer but he: And if they did, all to be the kinges of Portingall. So he armed a fleete, and in the yeere <hi>1487.</hi> was diſcouered y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ilands of <hi>Calicut,</hi> from whence is brought all the ſpice he hath. After this in the yeere <hi>1492.</hi> the king of Spaine willing to diſcouer landes towarde the Occident without making any ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or taking licence of the king of Portingale, armed certayne caruelles, and then diſcouered this India Occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, eſpecially two Ilandes of the ſaide India, that in this carde I ſet foorth named the one <hi>Ladominica,</hi> and the other <hi>Cuba,</hi> and brought certaine gold from thence. Of the which when the king of Portingall had knowledge, he ſent to the king of Spayne, requiring him to giue him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid Ilands. For that by the ſentence of the Pope all that ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered was his, and that he ſhould not proceede further in the diſcouerie without his licence. And at the ſame time it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that out of <hi>Caſtill,</hi> into Portingale had gone for feare of burning infinite number of Iewes that were expelled out of Spayne, for that they would not turne to be Chriſtians, &amp; carried with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> infinite number of gold &amp; ſiluer. So that it ſeemeth that the king of Spayne anſwered that it was reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the king of Portingall aſked, and that to bee obedient to
<pb facs="tcp:6277:18"/> that which the pope had decreed, he would giue him the ſaid Ilands of the Indies. Now for as much as it was decreed betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid kings, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none ſhould receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others ſubiects fugitiues, nor their goodes, therefore the king of Portingale ſhould pay and returne to the king of Spaine a million of Golde or more, that the Iewes had carried out of Spaine to Portingale; and that ſo doing he would giue theſe Ilandes and deſiſt from any more diſcouering. And not fulfilling this he would not onely not giue theſe Ilands, but procure to diſcouer more where him thought beſt. It ſeemeth that the king of Portingale would not or could not with his eaſe pay this mony. And ſo not paying that he coulde not let the king of Spaine to diſcouer: ſo that hee enterpriſed not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Orient where he had begun and found the ſpicery. And conſented to the king of Spaine that touching this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering they ſhould deuide the worlde betweene them two. And that all that ſhould be diſcouered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Capo verde,</hi> where this carde beginneth to be counted in the degrees of longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to <hi>180.</hi> of the ſayde ſcale of longitude, which is halfe the worlde toward the Orient, and finiſheth in this carde right ouer againſt a little croſſe made at the ſayde <hi>180.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to be the king of Portingalles. And all the lande from the ſayde Croſſe towarde the Occident, vntill it ioyneth with the other Croſſe in the Orient, which contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the other hundreth and eightie degrees, that is the other halfe of the worlde, to bee the king of Spaynes. So that from the lande ouer agaynſt the ſayde hundreth and eightie degrees vntill it finiſh in the three hundred and ſixtie on both the endes of the carde, is the iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the king of Spayne. So after this manner they deuided the worlde betweene them. Nowe for that theſe Ilandes of ſpicerie fall neere the terme and lymites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe Princes (for as by the ſayde carde you maye ſee they beginne from one hundred and ſixtie degrees of Longitude, and ende in <hi>215.</hi>) it ſeemeth all that falleth from <hi>160.</hi> to <hi>180.</hi> degrees, ſhoulde bee of Portingall:
<pb facs="tcp:6277:19"/> and all the reſt of Spayne. And for that their Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Pilots could not agree in the ſituation of the ſaid Ilands (for the Portingals ſet them al within their <hi>180.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and the Spaniards ſet them all without: &amp; for that in meaſuring, all the Coſmographers of both partes, or what other that euer haue beene ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not giue certaine order to meaſure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gitude of the world,<note place="margin">The longitudes harde to be founde out.</note> as they do of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> latitude: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no ſtarre fixed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eaſt to Weſt, as are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtarrs of the poles from North to South, but all mooueth with the mouing diuine:) no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner can be found how certainely it may be meaſured, but by coniectures, as the Nauigantes haue eſteemed the way they haue gone. But it is manifeſt that Spayne had the ſituation of all the landes from <hi>Capo verde,</hi> towarde the Orient of the Portingales to their <hi>180.</hi> degrees. And in all their cardes they neuer hitherto ſet the ſayd Ilands within their limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſayd <hi>180.</hi> degrees: (Though they knew very well of the Ilandes,) til nowe that the Spaniards diſcouered them. And it is knowne that the king of Portingale had trade to theſe Ilands afore, but would neuer ſuffer Portingale to goe thither from <hi>Calicut:</hi> for ſo much as hee knewe that it fell out of his dominion: leaſt by going thither there might come ſome knowledge of thoſe other Ilandes of the king of Spayne, but bought the cloues of Merchauntes of that countrie, that brought them to <hi>Calicut,</hi> much deerer then they would haue coſt, if he had ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thinking after this maner it would abide alwaies ſecrete. And now that it is diſcouered he ſendes and keepes the Spanierds from the trade all that he can. Alſo it ſhould ſee me that when this foreſaide conſent of the diuiſion of the worlde was agreed of betweene them, the king of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale had alreadye diſcouered certayne Ilandes that lye ouer againſt <hi>Capo verde,</hi> and alſo certayne parte of the mayne lande of India towarde the South, from whence he fet Braſill, and called it the lande of Braſill. So for that all ſhoulde come in his terme and limites, bee tooke three hundred and ſeuentie leagues beyonde
<pb facs="tcp:6277:19"/> 
               <hi>Capo verde:</hi> and after this, his <hi>180.</hi> degrees, being his part of the worlde, ſhoulde beginne in the Carde right ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>340</hi> degrees, where I haue made a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe with a croſſe, and ſhoulde finiſhe at the <hi>160.</hi> degree, where alſo I haue made an other little marke. And after this computation without any controuerſie, the Ilandes of the ſpicerie fall out of the Portingales domination. So that nowe the Spaniardes ſay to the Portingales that if they woulde beginne their <hi>180.</hi> degrees from the ſaide <hi>Capo verde,</hi> to the intent they ſhoulde extende more towarde the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riente, and ſo to touche thoſe Ilandes of the ſpicerie of the Emperour, which is all that is betweene the two croſſes made in this carde, that then the Ilandes of <hi>Capo verde</hi> and the lande of Braſill that the Portingales nowe obtaine, is out of the ſayde limitation, and that they are of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Or if their <hi>180.</hi> degrees they count from the <hi>370.</hi> leagues beyonde the ſayde <hi>Capo verde,</hi> to include in it the ſayde Ilandes and landes of Braſill, then plainely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſaide <hi>180.</hi> degrees ſhoulde finiſhe longe before they come to theſe Ilandes of the ſpicerie of the Emperour: As by this Carde your Lordeſhippe may ſee. For their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes ſhoulde beginne at the <hi>340.</hi> degrees, of this Carde, and ende at <hi>160.</hi> degrees, where I haue made two little marks of the compaſſe with croſſes in them.</p>
            <p>So that plainely it ſhoulde appeare by reaſon, that the Portingales ſhoulde leaue theſe Ilandes of <hi>Capo verde</hi> and land of Braſill, if they would haue part of the ſpicerie of the Emperours: or elſe holding theſe, they haue no parte there. To this the Portingales ſay, that they will beginne their <hi>180.</hi> degrees from the ſelfe ſame <hi>Capo verde:</hi> for that it maye extende ſo muche more towarde the oriente and touche theſe Ilandes of the Emperours: and woulde winne theſe Ilandes of <hi>Capo verde</hi> and lande of Braſill ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the leſſe, as a thinge that they poſſeſſed before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of this limitation was made.</p>
            <p>So none can verylye tell whiche hath the beſt reaſon.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:6277:20"/>
            <p>They bee not yet agreed, <hi>Quare ſub Iudice lis est.</hi> But without doubte by all coniectures of reaſon the ſayde Ilandes fall all without the limitation of Portingale, and pertayne to Spaine, as it appeareth by the moſt parte of all the Cardes made by the Portingales, ſaue thoſe they haue falſified of late purpoſely. But nowe touching that your Lordeſhippe wrote, whether that which wee diſcouered tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth any thing the foreſayde coaſtes:<note place="margin">New found la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diſcouered by the engliſhmen.</note> once it appeareth plainely that the Newe founde lande that wee diſcouered is all a mayne lande with the Indies occidentall, from whence the emperour hath all the golde and pearles: and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of coaſte more then <hi>5000.</hi> leagues of length, as by this Carde appeareth. For from the ſaide newe landes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth toward the occide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Indies, and from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies returneth toward the orient, &amp; after turneth ſouthwarde vp till it come to the ſtraytes of Todos Sanctos, whiche I reckon to bee more then <hi>5000.</hi> leagues.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note>So that to the Indians it ſhoulde ſeeme that wee haue ſome title, at leaſt that for our diſcouering wee might trade thither as other doe. But all this is nothing neere the ſpicerie.</p>
            <p>Nowe then (if from the ſayde newe founde landes the Sea bee Nauigable,<note place="margin">To ſayle by the pole.</note>) there is no doubte, but ſayling Northwarde and paſſing the pole deſcending to the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall lyne wee ſhall hitte theſe Ilandes, and it ſhoulde bee muche more ſhorter way, then eyther the Spaniardes or the Portingales haue. For wee bee diſtaunt from the pole but <hi>39.</hi> degrees, and from the pole to the Equinoctiall bee <hi>90.</hi> the which added together bee <hi>129.</hi> degrees, leagues <hi>2480.</hi> and myles <hi>7440.</hi> Where wee ſhoulde finde theſe Ilandes. And the Nauigation of the Spaniardes to the ſpicerie is, as by this Carde you may ſee, from Spayne to the Ilandes of Canarie, and from theſe Ilandes they runne ouer the lyne Equinoctiall Southwarde to the cape of the mayne lande of Indians, called the Cape of Sainte
<pb facs="tcp:6277:20"/> 
               <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and from this Cape Southwardes to the ſtraytes of Todos Sanctos,<note place="margin">Or the ſtraite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Magelan.</note> in the whiche Nauigation to the ſayde ſtraites is <hi>1700.</hi> or <hi>1800.</hi> leagues: and from theſe ſtraytes being paſt them, they returne towarde the line Equinoctiall to the Ilandes of ſpicerie, whiche are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante from the ſayde ſtraites <hi>4200.</hi> or <hi>4300.</hi> leagues.</p>
            <p>The Nauigation of the Portingalles to the ſayd Ilands is, departing from Portingale Southwarde towarde the <hi>Capo verde,</hi> and from thence to another Cape paſſing the lyne equinoctiall called <hi>Capo de bona ſperanſa,</hi> and from Portingale to the cape is <hi>1800.</hi> leagues, and from this cape to the Ilandes of ſpicerie of the Emperour is <hi>2500.</hi> leagues.</p>
            <p>So that by this nauigation amounteth all to <hi>4300.</hi> leagues. So that as afore is ſayde, if betweene our Newe founde landes or <hi>Norway,</hi> or Iſlande the Seas towarde the north be Nauigable, wee ſhoulde goe to theſe Ilandes a ſhorter way by more then <hi>2000</hi> leagues. And though wee went not to the ſaide Ilandes,<note place="margin">Note.</note> for that they are the Emperours or Kinges of Portingale, wee ſhoulde by the way, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming once to the line Equinoctiall, finde landes no leſſe riche of Golde and ſpicerie, as all other landes are vnder the ſaide line Equinoctiall: and alſo ſhoulde, if wee may paſſe vnder the North, enioye the Nauigation of all Tartarie.<note place="margin">Benefite to Englande.</note>

For though there is nothing in it preiudiciall to the Emperour, yet it may bee a cauſe of paine to the maker: as well for that none may make theſe Cardes, but certaine appointed and allowed for maſters, as for that peraduenture it woulde not ſounde well to them, that a ſtranger ſhoulde knowe or diſcouer their ſecretes: and wolde appeare worſt of all, if they vnderſtand that I write touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhort way to the ſpicerie by our Seas. Though peraduenture of troth it is not to bee looked too, as a thing that by all opinions is vnpoſſible, and I thinke neuer will come to effect: and therefore neither heere nor els where is it to bee ſpoken of. For to moue it amongeſt wiſemen, it ſhoulde bee had in deriſion. And therefore to none I woulde haue written nor ſpoken of ſuch things, but to your Lordſhip, to whome boldly I commit in this all my fooliſh fantaſie as to my ſelfe.

            <p>THis exhortation to king Henrie the eight, with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Doctor Ley his Ambaſſadour in Spaine, was preſerued by one maſter Emmanuel Lucar executour to maſter Robert Thorne, and was friendly imparted vnto mee by maſter Cyprian Lucar his ſonne an honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and very forwarde to further any good and landable action. And that it may bee knowne that this motion tooke preſent effect with the king, I thought it good here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to put downe the teſtimonie of our Chronicle that the king ſet out ſhippes for this diſcouerie in his life time. maſter Hall and maſter Grafton in their Chronicles write both thus: This ſame moneth king Henry the eight ſente two faire ſhips, well manned and victualed, hauing in them diuers cunning men, to ſeeke ſtrange regions: and ſo they ſet foorth, out of the Thames the xx. day of May in the xix. yeere of his raigne. In the yeere of our Lorde. <hi>1527.</hi>

Nowe by theſe preſents I will giue your Maieſtie to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, howe by the violence of the windes wee were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two ſhips, the <hi>Norman</hi> and the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> in ſuch euill caſe as they were, to lande in <hi>Britaine.</hi> Whereafter wee had repaired them in all pointes as was needefull and armed them very well, wee tooke our courſe a long by the coaſt of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Afterwardes with the <hi>Dolphin</hi> alone, wee determined to make diſcouerie of newe Countries, to proſecute the nauigation wee had alreadie begun, which I purpoſe at this preſent to recount vnto your Maieſtie, to make manifeſt the whole proceeding of the matter. The <hi>17</hi> of Ianuarie, the yeere <hi>1524.</hi> by the grace of God, wee departed from the diſhabited Rocke, by the Iſle of <hi>Madêra,</hi> appertaining to the king of <hi>Portingall,</hi> with fiftie men, with victuals, weapon, and other ſhip munition very well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided and furniſhed for 8. monethes: And ſayling weſtwards with a faire Eaſterly winde, in 25. dayes wee ranne 500. leagues, and the 20. of Februarie wee were ouertaken with as ſharpe and terrible a tempeſt as euer any ſaylers ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: whereof with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuine helpe &amp; mercifull aſſiſtaunce of Almightie God, and the goodneſſe of our ſhip accompanied
<pb facs="tcp:6277:24"/> with the good hap of her fortunate name wee were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and with a proſperous wind followed our courſe Weſt &amp; by North. And in other 25. dayes wee made aboue 400. leagues more, where wee diſcouered a newe land, neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeene of any man either auncient or moderne, and at the firſt ſight it ſeemed ſomewhat lowe, but beeing within a quarter of a league of it, wee perceiued by the great fiers that wee ſawe by the Sea coaſte that it was inhabited: and ſaw that the lande ſtretched to the Southwards: in ſeeking ſome conuenient harborough whereby to come a lande, and haue knowledge of the place, wee ſayled fiftie leagues in vaine, and ſeeing the lande to runn ſtill to the Southwards wee reſolued to returne backe againe towardes the North, where we found our ſelues troubled with the like difficulty: at length beeing in deſpaire to finde any port, wee caſte anker vpon the coaſt, and ſent our Boate to ſhore, where we ſawe great ſtore of people which came to the Sea ſide, and ſeeing vs to approche they fled away, and ſometimes would ſtande ſtill and looke backe, beholding vs with great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but afterwardes beeing animated and aſſured with ſignes that wee made them, ſome of them came harde to the Sea ſide ſeeming to reioyce very muche at the ſight of vs, and marueiling greatly at our apparell, ſhape and whitenes, ſhewed vs by ſundry ſignes where wee might moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly come a land with our Boat, offering vs alſo of their victuals to eate. Nowe I will briefly declare to your Maieſtie their life and manners, as farre as wee coulde haue notice thereof: Theſe people goe altogether naked except only that they couer their priuie partes with certaine ſkinnes of beaſtes like vnto Marterns, which they faſten vnto a narrowe girdle made of graſſe verye artificially wrought, hanged about with tailes of diuers other beaſtes, which rounde about their bodies hang dangling downe to their knees. Some of them weare garlandes of byrdes feathers. The people are of colour ruſſet, and not much vnlike the Saracens, their hayre blacke, thicke and
<pb facs="tcp:6277:24"/> not very long, which they tye togeather in a knot behinde &amp; weare it like a taile. They are wel featured in their limbs, of meane ſtature and commonly ſomewhat bigger then we, brode breaſted, ſtrong armes, their legges and other partes of their bodies well faſhioned, and they are diſfigured in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſauing that they haue ſomewhat brode viſages, and yet not all of them: for wee ſawe many of them well fauoured hauing blacke and great eyes, with a cheerefull and ſtedie looke, not ſtrong of body yet ſharpe witted, nymble and great runners, as farre as we coulde learne by experience, and in thoſe two laſt qualities they are like to the people of the Eaſt partes of the worlde, and eſpecially to them of the vttermoſt partes of <hi>China,</hi> wee coulde not learne of this people their manner of liuing, nor their particuler cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhort abode we made on the ſhore, our companie being but ſmall, and our ſhip ryding farre of in the Sea. And not farre from theſe we founde an other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe liuing wee thinke to bee like vnto theirs, (as heereafter I will declare vnto your Maieſtie,) ſhewing at this preſent the ſituation and nature of the foreſaide lande: The ſhore is all couered with ſmall ſande, and ſo aſcendeth vpwardes for the ſpace of fifteene foote riſing in forme of little hilles about fiftie paces broade. And ſayling forwards wee founde certaine ſmall Riuers and armes of the Sea, that enter at certain creekes, waſhing the ſhore on both ſides as the coaſt lyeth. And beyonde this wee ſawe the open Countrie riſing in height aboue the ſandie ſhore with many fayre fieldes and plaines, full of mightie great woods, ſome verie thicke and ſome thinne, repleniſhed with diuers ſortes of trees, as pleaſaunt and delectable to beholde as is poſſible to imagine. And your Maieſtie may not thinke that theſe are like the woodes of <hi>Hercinia</hi> or the wilde De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertes of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and the Northerne Coaſtes full of fruiteleſſe trees: But full of Palme trees, Bay trees, and high Cypreſſe trees, and many other ſortes of trees vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne in <hi>Europe,</hi> which yeeld moſt ſweete ſauours farre from the ſhore, the propertie whereof wee coulde not learne
<pb facs="tcp:6277:25"/> For the cauſe aforeſaide, and not for any difficultie to paſſe through the woods: Seeing they are not ſo thicke but that a man may paſſe through them. Neither doe wee thinke that they part taking of the Eaſt worlde rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them are all to geather voide of drugs or ſpicerie, and other richeſſe of golde, ſeeing the colour of the lande doth ſo much argue it and the lande is full of many beaſtes, as Stags, Deare and Hares, and likewiſe of Lakes and Pooles of Freſh water, with great plentie of foules, conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for all kinde of pleaſant game. This lande is in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 34.<note place="margin">Gr. 34.</note> D. with good and holſome ayre, temperate, betweene hot and colde, no vehement windes doe blowe in thoſe Regions, and thoſe that doe commonly raigne in thoſe Coaſtes, are the North Weſt and Weſt windes in the Sommer ſeaſon, (in the beginning whereof wee were there) the ſkie cleere and faire with very little raine: and if at any time the ayre bee cloudie and miſtie with the Sowtherne winde immediately it is diſſolued and waxeth cleare and fayre agayne. The Sea is caulme, not boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, the waues gentle, and although all the ſhore bee ſomewhat lowe and with out harborough: yet it is not daungerous to the ſaylers beeing free from rockes and deepe, ſo that within foure or fiue foote of the ſhore, there is twentie foote deepe of water without ebbe or flood, the depth ſtill increaſing in ſuch vniforme proportion. There is very good ryding at Sea: for any Ship beeing ſhaken in a tempeſt can neuer periſhe there by breaking of her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which wee haue proued by experience. For in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of March (as is vſuall in all Regions) beeing in the Sea oppreſſed with Northerne windes and riding there, wee founde our anker broken before the earth fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or mooued at all. Wee departed from this place ſtill running a long the coaſte, which we found to trende towarde the Eaſt, and wee ſaw euerie where verie great fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by reaſon of the multitude of the inhabitants. While we rode on that Coaſte partlie becauſe it had no harborough, and for that wee wanted water, wee ſent our Boat a ſhore
<pb facs="tcp:6277:25"/> with 25. men: whereby reaſon of great and continual waues that beate againſt the ſhore, being an open coaſt, without ſuccour, none of our men coulde poſſible goe a ſhore without looſing our boate. We ſawe there many people which came vnto the ſhore, making diuers ſignes of friendſhip, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were content wee ſhoulde come a lande, and by trial we found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be very courteous &amp; gentle as your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſhal vnderſtand by the ſucceſſe.<note place="margin">Courteous and gentle people.</note> To the intent we might ſende them of our thinges, which the Indians commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier and eſteeme as ſheetes of Paper, glaſſes, belles, and ſuch like trifles: Wee ſent a young man one of our Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners a ſhore, who ſwimming towards them, and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 3. or 4. yeards off the ſhore, not truſting them, caſt the thinges vpon the ſhore, ſeeking afterwardes to returne, hee was with ſuch violence of the waues beaten vpon the ſhore, that he was ſo bruiſed that hee lay there almoſt dead, whiche the Indians perceiuing, ranne to catche him, and drawing him out they carried him a little way of from the ſea: The young man perceiuing they caried him, beeing at the firſt diſmaide, began then greatly to feare and cried out pitiouſly, likewiſe did the Indians which did accompanie him, going about to cheere him and giue him courage, and then ſetting him on the grounde at the foote of a little hill againſt the ſunne, beganne to beholde him with great admiration, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiling at the whiteneſſe of his fleſhe: And putting off his clothes they made him warme at a great fire, not without our great feare which remained in the boate, that they would haue roſted him at that fire and haue eaten him. The young man hauing recouered his ſtrength, and hauing ſtayed a while with them, ſhewed them by ſignes that hee was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to returne to the ſhippe: And they with great loue clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him faſt about with many embracings, accompanying him vnto the ſea, and to put him in more aſſurance, leauing him alone they went vnto a high grounde and ſtoode there, beholding him vntil he was entred into the boate. This yong man obſerued as we did alſo, that theſe are of colour encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Blacke as the other were, with their fleſhe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:6277:26"/> ſhining of meane ſtature, handſome viſag, and dilicate limmes and of verie little ſtrength: but of prompt witte, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee obſerued not.</p>
            <p>Departing from hence following the ſhore which tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſomewhat towarde the North in 50. leagues ſpace, wee came to another lande which ſhewed much more faire and full of woods, being very great, where we rode at Ancker, and that wee might haue ſome knowledge thereof, wee ſent 20. men a lande, which entred into the countrey about two leagues, and they founde that the people were fledde to the woods for feare, they ſawe onely one olde woman with a young maide of 18. or 20. yeeres olde, which ſeeing our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie hid them ſelues in the graſſe for feare, the olde woman caried two Infantes on her ſhoulders, and behinde her necke a childe of 8. yeeres olde: the yong woman was laden like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with as many: but when our men came vnto them, the women cryed out, the olde woman made ſignes that the men were fled vnto the woods, as ſoone as they ſawe vs to quiet them and to winne their fauour, our men gaue them ſuche victuals as they had with them to eate, which the old woman receiued thankfully: but the yong woman diſdained them al, and threwe them diſdainefully on the grounde, they tooke a childe from the olde woman to bring into Fraunce, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to take the young woman which was verye beaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull &amp; of tal ſtature, they could not poſſibly for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries that ſhee made bring her to the ſea, and eſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing great woods to paſſe through, and being farre from the ſhippe, wee purpoſed to leaue her behinde bearing away the childe onely. We found thoſe folkes to bee more white than thoſe that we founde before, being clad with certaine leaues y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hang on boughes of trees, which they ſowe together with thredes of wilde hempe, their heads were truſſed vp after the ſame manner as the former were, their ordinarie foode is of pulſe, whereof they haue great ſtore, differing in colour &amp; taſte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ours, of good &amp; plaſant taſte. Moreouer they liue by fiſhing &amp; fouling which they take with ginnes, and bowes made of hard wood the arrowes of Canes, being
<pb facs="tcp:6277:26"/> headed with the bones of fiſhe and other beaſtes. The beaſtes in theſe parts are much wilder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our <hi>Europe,</hi> by reaſon they are continually chaſed and hunted. Wee ſawe many of their boates made of one tree 20. foote long, and 4. foote broade, which are not made with Iron, or ſtone, or any other kinde of metal, (becauſe that in all this countrie for the ſpace of 200. leagues whiche we ranne, wee neuer ſawe one ſtone of any ſort): they help themſelues with fyre, burning ſo much of the tree as is ſufficient for the hollowneſſe of the boate, the like they doe in making the ſterne and the foreparte vntill it be fitte to ſaile vpon the ſea. The lande is in ſituation, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fairenes like the other: it hath woods like the other, thinne and full of diuers ſortes of trees: but not ſo ſweete be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the countrey is more northerly and cold.</p>
            <p>Wee ſawe in this Countrey many Vines growing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, which growing vp take hold of the trees as they do in Lombardie, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> if by huſbandmen they were dreſſed in good order, without all doubte they woulde yeelde excellent wines: for wee hauing oftentymes ſeene the fruite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of dried, whiche was ſweete and pleaſaunt, and not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from ours. Wee doe thinke that they doe eſteeme the ſame, becauſe that in euery place where they growe, they take away the vnder braunches growing rounde about, that the fruite thereof may ripen the better.</p>
            <p>We found alſo roſes, violettes, lillies, and many ſorts of herbes, and ſweete and odoriferous flowers different from ours. We knewe not their dwellinges, becauſe they were farre vp in the lande, and wee iudge by manye ſignes that wee ſawe, that they are of wood and of trees framed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Wee doe beleeue alſo by many coniectures and ſignes, that many of them ſleeping in the fieldes, haue no other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer then the open ſkye. Further knowledge haue wee not of them, we thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the reſt whoſe countreys we paſſed liue all after one manner, hauing our aboade three dayes in this cuntrey, riding on the coaſt for want of harboroughs, we
<pb facs="tcp:6277:27"/> concluded to departe from thence, trending along the ſhore betweene the North and the Eaſt, ſayling onely in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, &amp; riding at ancker by night in the ſpace of 100. leagues ſayling, wee founde a very pleaſant place, ſituated amongſt certaine litle ſteepe hilles: from amiddeſt the which hilles there ran down into the ſea a great ſtreame of water, which within the mouth was very deep, &amp; from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of ſame with the tyde which wee found to riſe 8. foot, any great veſſell laden may paſſe vp.</p>
            <p>But becauſe wee rode at Ancker in a place well fenſed from the winde, wee woulde not venture our ſelues without knowledge of the place, and wee paſſed vp with our boate onely into the ſayde Riuer, and ſawe the Countrey very wel peopled. The people are almoſt like vnto the others, and clad with the fethers of foules of diuers colours, they came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs very cherefully, making great ſhowtes of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſhewing vs where we might come to lande moſt ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our boate. We entred vp the ſaid riuer into the lande about halfe a league, where it made a moſt pleaſant lake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3. leagues in compaſſe: on the which they rowed from the one ſide to the other to the number of 30. of their ſmall boates: wherein were many people whiche paſſed from one ſhore to the other to come and ſee vs, and beholde vpon the ſodaine (as it is wont to fall out in ſayling) a contrarie flawe of winde comming from the ſea, wee were enforced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our Shippe, leauing this lande to our great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment,<note place="margin">The pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and riches of the lande.</note> for the great commoditie and pleaſantneſſe thereof whiche wee ſuppoſe is not without ſome ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, all the hills ſhewing minerall matters in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ancker, and ſayled towarde the Eaſt, for ſo the coaſt tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſo alwayes for 50. leagues being in the ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee diſcouered and Ilande in forme of a triangle,<note place="margin">The deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Claudia I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande.</note> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from the maine lande 3. leagues, about the bigneſſe of the Ilande of the <hi>Rodes,</hi> it was full of hilles couered with trees,<note place="margin">Claudia was wife of King Francis.</note> well peopled, for we ſawe fires all along the coaſte, wee gaue the name of it, of your Maieſties mother, not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there by reaſon of the weather being contrarie.</p>

There were amongſt theſe people 2. kings of ſo goodly ſtature and ſhape as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to declare, the eldeſt was about 40. yeeres of ag, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was a yong man of 20. yeres old. Their apparell was on this maner, the elder had vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his naked body a harts ſkin wrought artificialie with diuers braunches like Damaſke, his head was bare with the haire tyed vp behinde with diuers knottes: About his necke he had a large chaine, garniſhed with diuers ſtones of ſundrie colours the young man was almoſt appareled after the ſame manner. This is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt people and of the faireſt conditions that wee haue found in this our voyage. They exceed vs in bignes, they are of the colour of braſſe, ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> encline more to whitnes: others are of yellowe colour, of comely viſage with long &amp; blacke heire which they are very carefull to trim and decke vp, they are blacke and quicke eyed. I write not to your Maieſtie, of the other parte of their bodie, hauing all ſuche proportion as appertayneth to anye handſome man. The women are of the like conformitie and Beawtie, verie handſome and well fauoured, they are as well mannered and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nente as anye women, of good education, they are all naked ſaue their priuie partes whiche they couer with a Deares ſkinne braunched or embrodered as the men vſe: there are alſo of them whiche weare on their armes verie riche ſkinnes of leopardes, they adorne their heades with diuers ornamentes made of their owne heire, whiche hange

            <p>Among whom wee ſawe many plates of wrought coper, which they eſteeme more then golde, whiche for the colour they make no accompt of, for that among all other it is counted the baſeſt, they make moſt accompt of <hi>Azure</hi> and <hi>red.</hi> The things that they eſteemed moſt of al thoſe which we gaue them were bels, criſtall of Azure colour, and other toies to hang at their eares or about their necke. They did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire cloth of ſilke or of golde, muche leſſe of any other ſorte, neither cared they for thinges made of ſteele and Iron, which wee often ſhewed them in our armour whiche they made no wonder at, and in beholding them they onely aſked the arte of making them: the like they did at our glaſſes, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the behelde, they ſodainely laught and gaue them vs againe. They are very liberal for they giue that which they haue, we became great friendes with theſe, and one day wee entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hauen with our ſhippe, where as before wee rode a league of at ſea by reaſon of the contrary weather. They came in great companies of their ſmall boates vnto the ſhip with their faces all be painted with diuers colours, ſhewing vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a ſigne of ioy, bringing vs of their victuals, they made ſignes vnto vs where wee might ſafeſt ride in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the ſafegarde of our ſhippe keeping ſtill our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: and after we were come to an Ancker, we beſtowed fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes in prouiding our ſelues many neceſſary things, whether euery day the people repayred to ſee our ſhip bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wiues with them, whereof they are very ielous: and they themſelues entring abrode the ſhippe and ſtayinge there a good ſpace, cauſed their wiues to ſtay in their boates, and for al the intreatie we could make, offering to giue them diuers things, we could neuer obtaine that they would ſuffer them to come aborde our ſhip. And oftentimes one of the two kings comming with his queene, and many gentlemen for their pleaſure to ſee vs, they all ſtayed on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhore two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

The queene and her maids ſtayed in a very light boate, at an Iland a quarter of a leage off, while the king abode a long ſpace in our ſhip vttering diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites with geaſtures, viewing with great admiration, all the furniture of the ſhippe, demaunding the propertie of euerie thing perticularly. He tooke likewiſe great pleaſure in beholding our apparell, and in taſting our meates, and ſo courteouſly taking his leaue departed. And ſometimes our men ſtaying for two or three dayes on a litle Ilande nere the ſhip for diuers neceſſaries, (as it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of ſeamen) he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with 7. or 8. of his gentlemen to ſee what we did, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of vs oft times if wee meant to make any long aboade there, offering vs of their prouiſion: then the king drawing his bowe and running vp and downe with his gentlemen, made much ſporte to gratifie our men, wee were oftentimes within the lande 5. or 6. leagues, which we found as pleaſant as is poſſible to declare very apt for any kinde of huſbandry of corne, wine and oyle: for that there are plaines 25. or 30. leagues broad, open and without any impediment of trees of ſuch fruitfulneſſe, that any ſeede being ſowne therein, will bring forth moſt excellent fruite. We entred afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woods which wee found ſo great and thicke, that any armie were it neuer ſo great might haue hid it ſelfe therein, the trees whereof are okes, cipres trees, and other ſortes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen in <hi>Europe.</hi> We found Pomi appii, Damſon trees, and Nutte trees, and many other ſorts of fruits differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ours: there are beaſts in great abundance, as hartes, deares, leopardes, and other kinds which they take with their nets &amp; bowes which are their chiefe weapons, the arrowes whiche they vſe are made with great cunning, and in ſteade of iron, they head them with ſmeriglio, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iaſper ſtone, &amp; hard mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; other ſharp ſtones which they vſe in ſtead of iron to cut

We ſawe their houſes made in circuler or rounde fourme 10. or 12. foote in compaſſe, made with halfe circles of timber, ſeperate one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without any order of building, couered with mattes of ſtrawe wrought cunningly together, which ſaue them from the winde and raine, and if they had the order of building and perfect ſkil of workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip as we haue: there were no doubt but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would alſo make eftſoones great and ſtately buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. For all the ſea coaſtes are full of cleare and gliſtering ſtones, and alablaſter, and therefore it is full of good hauens and barbarours for ſhips. They mooue the foreſaide houſes from one place to another according to the commoditie of the place and ſeaſon wherein they will make their aboade, and only taking of the couer, they haue other houſes builded incontinent. The father and the whole familie dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one houſe in great number: in ſome of them we ſawe 25. or 30. perſons. They feede as the other doe aforeſaide of pulſe whiche doe growe in that countrey with better order of huſbandry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the others. They obſerue in their ſowing the courſe of the Moone and the riſing of certaine ſtarres, and diuers other cuſtomes ſpoken of by antiquitie. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, they liue by hunting and fiſhing. they liue long, and are ſeldome ſicke, and if they chaunce to fall ſicke at any time, they heale them ſelues with fire without any phiſition, and they ſay that they die for very age. They are very pitiful and charitable towardes their neighbours, they make great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations in their aduerſitie &amp; in their miſerie, the kinred recken vp all their felicitie, at their departure out of life, they vſe mourning mixt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſinging, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> continueth for a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſpace. This is aſmuch as wee coulde learne of them. This lande is ſituated in the Paralele of <hi>Rome,</hi> in 41. degrees &amp; 2. terces:
<pb facs="tcp:6277:29"/> but ſomewhat more colde by accidentall cauſe and not of nature, (as I will declare vnto your highneſſe els where) deſcribing at this preſent the ſituation of the foreſaide coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, which lyeth Eaſt and Weſt, I ſay that the mouth of the hauen lyeth open to the South halfe a league broade, and being entred within it betweene the Eaſt and the North, it ſtretcheth twelue leagues: where it waxeth broder and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and maketh a gulfe aboute 20. leagues in compaſſe, wherein are fine ſmall Iſlandes very fruitfull and pleaſant, full of hie and broade trees, among the which Ilandes, any great Nauie may ryde ſafe without any feare of tempeſt or other daunger. Afterwardes turning towards the South and in the entring into the Hauen on both ſides there are moſt pleaſant hilles, with many riuers of moſt cleere water falling into the Sea.</p>
            <p>In the middeſt of this entraunce there is a rock of free ſtone growing by nature apt to builde any Caſtle or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe there, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keeping of the hauen. The fift of May be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furniſhed with all thinges neceſſarie, we departed from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid Coaſt keeping along in the ſight thereof, &amp; we ſayled 150 leagues finding it all wayes after one manner: but the lande ſomewhat higher with certaine mountaines all which beare a ſhewe of minerall matter, wee ſought not to lande there in any place, becauſe the weather ſerued our turne for ſayling: but wee ſuppoſe that it was like to the former, the Coaſt ranne Eaſtward for the ſpace of fiftie leagues. And trending afterwardes the North, wee founde another lande high full of thicke woods, the trees whereof were firres, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes and ſuch like as are wont to growe in colde Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The people differ much from the other, &amp; looke how much the former ſeemed to be courteous and gentle: ſo much were theſe full of rudeneſſe and ill manners, and ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that by no ſignes that euer wee coulde make, wee could haue any kinde of trafficke with them. They cloth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with Beares ſkinnes and Leopardes and ſealles and other beaſtes ſkinnes. Their foode as farre as wee coulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieue,
<pb facs="tcp:6277:30"/> repayring often vnto their dwellings wee ſuppoſe to bee by hunting and fiſhing, and of certaine fruites, which are a kinde of rootes, which the earth yeeldeth of her owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. They haue no graine, neither ſawe wee any kinde or ſigne of tyllage, neither is the lande, for the barrennes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of apt to beare frute or ſeed. If at any time we deſired by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge to haue any of their commodities, they vſed to come to the Sea ſhore vpon certaine craggie rocks, and wee ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in our Boats, they let downe with a rope what it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to giue vs, crying continually that wee ſhould not approch to the lande, demanding immediately the exchange taking nothing but kniues, fiſhookes and tooles to cut with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, neither did they make any account of our curteſie. And when we had nothing left to exchange with them, when we departed from them the people ſhewed all ſignes of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie and diſdaine, as was poſſible for any creature to inuent. Wee were in deſpight of them two or three leagues within the lande, being in number 25. armed men of vs: And when wee went on ſhore they ſhot at vs with their bowes, making great outcries, and afterwardes fled into the woods. Wee founde not in this lande any thing notable, or of importance, ſauing very great woods and certaine hilles, they may haue ſome mynerall matter in them, becauſe wee ſawe many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue beadſtones of Copper hanging at their eares. We departed from thence keeping our courſe North Eaſt along the coaſte, which wee founde more pleaſant champion and without woods, with high mountaines within the lande continuing directly along the coaſt for the ſpace of fiftie leagues, wee diſcouered 32. Ilelandes lying all neare the lande, being ſmall and pleaſant to the viewe, high and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many turnings and windings betwene them, making many fayre harboroughes and chanels as they doe in the goulfe of <hi>Venice</hi> in <hi>Saluonia,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> wee had no knowledge or acquaintance with the people: wee ſuppoſe they are of the ſame maners and nature that the others are. Sayling Northeaſt for the ſpace of 150. leagues we appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb facs="tcp:6277:30"/> to the lande that in times paſt was diſcouered by the <hi>Britons,</hi> which is in fiftie degrees. Hauing now ſpent all our prouiſion and victuals, and hauing diſcouered about 700. leagues and more of newe Countries, and being furniſhed with Water and Wood wee concluded to returne into <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the religion of this people, which wee haue founde for want of their language we could not vnderſtand neither by ſignes nor geſture that they had any religion or lawe at all, or that they did acknowledge any firſt cauſe or mouer, neither that they worſhip the heauen or ſtarres the Sunne or Moone or other Planets, and much leſſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee idolaters, neither coulde wee learne whether that they vſed any kinde of Sacrifices or other adorations, neither in their villages haue they any Temples or houſes of prayer. We ſuppoſe that they haue no religion at all, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they liue at their owne libertie. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of ignorance, for that they are very eaſie to bee perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and all that they ſee vs Chriſtians doe in our diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice they did the ſame with the like imitation as they ſawe vs to doe it.</p>

To theſe things our Prince anſwered nothing at all, but cauſing his men to ſeeke ſome good harborough, hee made ſignes as though he would come on land, and ſayling round about the Iland, hee eſpied at length a harborough on the Eaſt ſide of the Ilande, where he put in with all his Fleet, the mariners went on land to take in wood and water, which they did with as great ſpeede as they coulde, doubting leaſt they ſhoulde be aſſaulted by the inhabitants as it fell out in deed, for thoſe that dwelt there abouts, making ſignes vnto the other with fire and ſmoke, put them ſelues preſently in armes and the other comming to them, they came al running downe to the Sea ſide vpon our men, with bowes and arrowes and other weapons, that many were ſlaine and diuers ſore wounded. And we made ſignes of peace vnto them, but it was to no purpoſe, for their rage encreaſed more and more, as though they had fought for life and liuing.

So therefore it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that it hath pleaſed God by his godly prouidence to
<pb facs="tcp:6277:41"/> reſerue the care which hee hath had of their ſaluation vntill this time, and will bring them to our faith, at the time by himſelfe alone foreſeene and ordeined.

Of the which there was one a very famous ſtranger named Sebaſtian Gabota<note place="margin">Sebaſtian Gabota.</note> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pylot ſent thither by king Henry, the yeere 1498. and many others, who neuer could attaine to any habitation nor take poſſeſſion thereof one only foote of grounde, nor yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche or enter into theſe parties and faire riuers into the which God hath brought vs. Wherefore (my Lorde) it may bee well ſaide that the liuing God hath reſerued this great lande for your poore ſeruantes and ſubiectes, as well to the ende they might bee made great ouer this poore people, &amp; rude nation: as alſo to approue the former affection which our kings haue had vnto this diſcouerie.</p>
            <p>For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> late king Frances the firſt (of happie memorie) a Prince endued with excellent vertues. The yeere 1524. ſent a famous and notable man a Florentine, named Maſter Iohn Verarzan,<note place="margin">Iohn Verarza<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> to ſearch and diſcouer the Weſt parts as farre as might be: Who departing from Deepe with two veſſels little differing from the making and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of theſe two Pinnaces of the kinges, which your honour hath ordeined for this preſent nauigation. In the which land they haue found the eleuation the Pole, an viii. degrees.

The which occaſion gaue ſmall courage to ſende thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and was the cauſe that this laudable enterpriſe was left of, vntill the yeere 1534. at which time his Maieſtie, (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring alwayes to enlarge his kingdome, countreys and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and the aduauncing and eaſe of his ſubiectes) ſent thither a Pilote of S.

When wee had done your buſineſſe, and made our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the xviii. day of Februarie 1562 through the fauour of God wee departed with our two veſſels out of the hauen of Claue de Grace into the road Caur: and the next day hoyſted vp ſaile (the winde being in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eaſt) which laſted ſo fiue daies, that we coulde not arriue at the nauch that is from betweene the coaſt of Briton and Englande and the Iles of Surlinos and Wiſkam: So that the Winde blowing with great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and tempeſt out of the Weſt, and Weſt Southweſt, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether contrary to our way and courſe, and all that we could doe was to none effecte, beſides the great daunger of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our Maſtes, as alſo to be hindered in our other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Wherefore as well to ſhonne many other inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which might follow to the preiudice and breach of our voyage, hauing regard alſo to the likely daunger of death, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſome of our gentlemen and ſouldiers being troubled with feuers and whot ſickneſſes, might haue fallen into: as alſo
<pb facs="tcp:6277:42"/> for other conſiderations, wee thought good to fall into the road of Breſt in Britaine, to ſet there our ſick folke on land, and ſuffer the tempeſt to paſſe. From whence (after wee had taried there two dayes) wee returned againe to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to followe our nauigation, ſo that (my Lorde) albeit the winde was for a long ſeaſon very much againſt vs, and troubleſome: yet at the ende (God giuing vs through his grace and accuſtomed goodneſſe a meetely fauourable winde) I determined with all diligence to proue a newe courſe which hath not beene yet attempted: trauerſing the Seas of Oction 1800. Leagues at the leaſt, whiche in deed is the true and ſhort courſe that hereafter muſt be kept, to the honour of our nation, reiecting the old conſerued opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which to long time hath beene holden as true.</p>
            <p>Which is, as it was thought a thing impoſſible to haue the winde at Eaſt, Northeaſt, and keepe the race and courſe wee enterpriſed, but that we ſhoulde be driuen towarde the region of Affrica, the Iles of Canaria, Madera, and other landes there aboutes. And the cauſe why we haue beene the more prouoked and aſſured to take this new race, hath bin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it ſeemed to euery one, that we might not paſſe nor goe in this Nauigation without the ſight and touching of the Antillies and Lucaries, and there ſoiourne and take freſh waters and other neceſſaries, as the Spaniards doe in their voyage to new ſpaine: wherof (thanked be God) we haue had no neede, nor entered the chanell of Roham: which hath bin thought impoſſible. Foreſeeing alſo that it was not expedient for vs to paſſe through the Ilandes, as wel to ſhune many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences that might happen in paſſing that way (wherof ſpringeth nothing but innumerable quarrels, pleadings, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:6277:42"/> goodly newe framing people, of ſo gentle a nature, and a countrey ſo pleaſant and fruitefull, lacking nothing at all that may ſeeme neceſſarie for mans food) we would not haue to doe with their Ilandes, and other landes: which (for that they firſt diſcouered them) they keepe with much ielouſie: truſting that if God will ſuffer the king (through your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwation) to cauſe ſome part of this incomparable countrey to be peopled and inhabited with ſuch a number of his poore ſubiectes as you ſhall thinke good, there neuer happened in the memory of man ſo great and good commoditie to France as this, and (my Lorde) for many cauſes, whereof a man is neuer able to ſay or write to the ful, as vnder the aſſured hope that we haue alwayes had in executing vprightly that which I had receiued in charge of you, God woulde bleſſe our wayes and nauigations. After we had conſtantly and with diligence in time conuenient determined vpon the way, wee ſhoulde haue thought it noyſome and tedious to all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, if it had before bin knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto any without tourning or wauering to or fro from their firſt ententio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſatan did often what he could to ſowe many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractes, troubles and lettes, according to his acuſtomed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, ſo it is come to paſſe, that God by his onely goodnes hath giuen vs grace, to make the furtheſt arte and trauars of the ſeas, that euer was made in our memorie or knowledge, in longitude from the Eaſt to the Weſt: and therefore was it commonly ſayde both in Fraunce and Spaine, and alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, that it was impoſſible for vs ſafely to ariue thither, whither the Lord did conduct vs. Al which perſwaded but of igoraunce and lacke of attempting: which wee haue not bin afrayde to giue aduenture to prooue. Albeit that all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners Cardes doe ſet the Coaſtes with ſhipwrackes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out portes or Riuers: which wee haue found otherwiſe as it followeth.</p>
            <p>Thurſday the laſt of Aprill at the breake of the day, wee diſcouered and clearely perceyued a fayre Coaſt, ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng of a great length couered with an infinite number of
<pb facs="tcp:6277:43"/> high and fayre trees, wee being not paſt 7. or 8. leagues from the ſhore, the countrey ſeeming vnto vs plaine without anye ſhewe of hils, and approching neerer within foure or fiue lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues of the land, we caſt an ancker at ten fadome water, the bottome of the Sea being plaine with muche Ocias and faſt holde on the South ſide, as farre as a certaine point or Cape ſituate vnder that Latitude of nine and twentie degrees and a halfe, which we haue named Cape Francois.</p>
            <p>Wee coulde eſpie neither Riuer nor Bay, wherefore wee ſent our Boates furniſhed with men of experience, to founde and knowe the coaſt neere the ſhore: who returning to vs about one of the clock at after noone, declared that they had founde among other thinges viii. fadome of water at the harde bancke of the ſea. Wherevpon hauing diligently wayed vp our Anckers, and hoyſted vp our ſayles with wind at will, we ſayled and vewed the coaſt all along with vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſure, of the odorous ſmell and beawtie of the ſame. And becauſe there appeared vnto vs no ſigne of any Porte, about the ſetting of the ſunne we caſt ancker againe: which done, we did behold to and fro the goodly order of the woods wherewith God hath decked euery way the ſayd land. Then perceiuing towarde the North a leaping and a breaking of the water, as a ſtreame falling out of the lande into the Sea. For the whiche wee ſet vp ſayles againe to double the ſame while it was yet day. And as wee had ſo done, and paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it: there appeared vnto vs a fayre entrie of a faire riuer which cauſed vs to caſt Ancker agayne there nerer the land: to the end the next day we might ſee what it was, and though that the winde blew for a time vehemently to the ſhoreward: yet the hold and Anckerrage was ſo good, that one cable and one Ancker helde vs faſt, with out danger or ſliding.</p>
            <p>The next day in the morning, being the firſt of May, wee aſſayed to enter this Porte, with two newe barges and a boate well trimmed, finding little water barges whiche might haue aſtonied and cauſed vs to returne backe to ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borde, if God had not ſpeedily brought vs in. Where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 36. fadome water, entred into a goodly and great riuer,
<pb facs="tcp:6277:43"/> which as we went founde to encreaſe ſtill in depth &amp; large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, boyling and roaring through the multitude of all kind of fiſh. This being entred wee perceiued a great number of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Indians inhabitants there, comming along the ſandes &amp; Sea bankes, comming neare vnto vs, without any taking of feare or doubt, ſhewing vnto vs the eaſieſt landing place: &amp; thereupon we giuing them alſo on our parts thanks of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance and friendlineſſe. Forthwith one of appearance, out of the beſt among them, brother vnto one of their kinges, or gouernours, commaunded one of the Indians to enter into the water: and to approch our boates to ſhew vs the coaſtes landing place. We ſeeing this (without any more doubting or difficultie) landed, and the meſſenger (after we had rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him with ſome looking glaſſe, and other pretie things of ſmall value) ran incontinently toward his Lord: Who forth with ſent mee his girdle, in token of aſſuraunce and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which girdle was made of red leather, as well couered and coloured as was poſſible: and as I began to go towards him, hee ſet foorth and came and receiued me gently, and rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed after his maner all his men, following with great ſilence and modeſtie: yea more then our men did. And after we had a while with gentle vſage congratulated with him: we fell to the grounde a litle way from them, to call vpon the name of God, and to beſeech him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue ſtill his goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, and bring to the knowledge of our ſauiour Chriſt this poore people. While wee were thus praying (they ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon the grounde, which was ſtrawed and dreſſed with Bay bowes) behelde and hearkened vnto vs, very attentiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without either ſpeking or mouing: and as I made a ſigne vnto their king, lifting vp mine arme, and ſtretching foorth one finger, only to make them looke vp to heauen ward: He likewiſe lifting vp his arme towards heauen put foorth two fingers: whereby it ſeemed that he made vs to vnderſtande, that they worſhipped the Sunne and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moone for Gods: as afterwardes wee vnderſtoode it ſo. In the meane time their numbers increaſed, &amp; thither came the kings brother, that was firſt with vs, their mother, wiues, ſiſters and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb facs="tcp:6277:44"/> and being thus aſſembled, they cauſed a great number of Bay boughes to bee cut, and therewith a place to be dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for vs, diſtant from theirs two fadom. For it is their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to talke and bargaine ſitting: and the chiefe of them to bee apart, from the meaner ſort, with a ſhewe of great obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their kinges, ſuperiours, and elders. They bee all naked, and of a goodly ſtature, mightie, &amp; as well ſhapen &amp; proportioned of body, as any people in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: very gentle, curteous, and of a good nature.</p>
            <p>The moſt part of them couer their raines and priuities with faire Harts ſkinnes, painted moſt commonly with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie colours: and the fore part of their body and armes, bee painted with pretie deuiſed workes, of Azure, red, and blacke, ſo well and ſo properly as the beſt Painter of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope coulde not amende it. The women haue their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies painted with a certaine Herbe like vnto Moſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Cedar trees, and all other trees bee alwayes couered. The men for pleaſure doe alwayes trimme them ſelues therwith, after ſundrie faſhions: They bee of tauny colour, hauke noſed, and of a pleaſant countenance. The women be well fauoured, and will not ſuffer one diſhoneſtly to approch too neare them. But wee were not in their houſes for we ſawe none at that time.</p>
            <p>After we had taried in this North ſide of the riuer the moſt part of the day (which riuer wee haue called May,<note place="margin">Why the riuer of May was ſo called.</note> for that wee diſcouered the ſame the firſte day of the Moneth) wee congratulated, made aliaunce, and entred into ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with them, and preſented the king and his brethren with Gownes of blewe cloth garniſhed with yellowe Floure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luces. And it ſeemed that they were ſory for our departure: ſo that the moſt part of them entred into the water vp to the necke, to ſet our boates a flote.</p>
            <p>Putting into vs ſundry kinde of fiſhes, which with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous ſpeede they ranne to take in their packs, made in the water with great Reedes, ſo well and cunningly ſet togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after the faſhion of a Laberinth, or Maze, with ſo many
<pb facs="tcp:6277:44"/> turnes and crookes, as it is impoſſible to do it without much cunning and induſtrie.</p>
            <p>But deſiring to imploy the reſt of the day on the other ſide of this riuer, to viewe and know thoſe Indians that wee ſawe there. We trauerſed thither, and without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie landed amongeſt them, who receiued vs very gently and with great humanitie: putting vs of their fruites, euen into our boates, Mulberies, Raſpis, and ſuch other fruites as they founde ready by the way.</p>
            <p>Soone after this came thither the king with his brethren, and others with bowes and arrowes in their handes, vſing therewithall a goodly and a graue faſhion, with their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour right ſouldierlike, and as warlike boldnes as may be. They were naked and painted as the other, their haire like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe long, and truſſed vp (with a lace made of herbes) to the top of their heads: but they had neither their wiues nor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their companie. After we had a good while louingly enterteined and preſented them with like gifts of haberſher wares, cutting hookes and hatchets, and clothed the king &amp; his brethren with like robes, as we had giuen to them on the other ſide: we entred and viewed the countrie thereaboutes, which is the faireſt, fruitfulleſt, &amp; pleaſanteſt of al the world, abounding in hony, veniſon, wilde foule, foreſts, woods of all ſortes, Palme trees, Cypreſſe and Cedars, Bayes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and greateſt, with alſo the fayreſt vines in all the world, with grapes according, which without natural art and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mans helpe or trimming will grow to toppes of Okes, and other trees that be of a wonderfull greatneſſe &amp; height. And the ſight of the faire medowes is a pleaſure not able to be expreſſed with tongue: full of Hernes, Curlues, Bitters, Mallards, Egrepths, woodcocks, &amp; all other kinde of ſmall birds: with Harts, Hindes, Buckes, wilde Swine, and all other kindes of wilde beaſtes, as we perceiued well both by their footing there, and alſo afterwardes in other places, by their crie and roaring in the night.</p>
            <p>Alſo there be Conies &amp; Hares: Silke wormes in meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous number, a great deale fairer and better, then be our ſilk
<pb facs="tcp:6277:45"/> wormes. To bee ſhort, it is a thing vnſpeakeable to conſider the thinges that bee ſeene there, and ſhalbe founde more and more, in this incomperable lande, which neuer yet broken with plough yrons, bringeth forth al things according to his firſt nature, wherewith the eternall God indued it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their houſes they labour and till the grounde, ſowing their fieldes with a graine called Mahis, whereof they make their meale: and in their Gardens they plant beanes, gourdes, cucumbers, Citrons, peaſon, and many other fruits and rootes vnknowen vnto vs. Their ſpades and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks be made of Wood, ſo well and fitly as is poſſible: which they make with certaine ſtones, oyſter ſhelles &amp; muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, wherewith alſo they make their bowes and ſmal laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and cut &amp; poliſh all ſortes of wood, that they imploye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their buildings, and neceſſarie vſe: There groweth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many Walnut trees, Haſell trees, Cheritrees, very faire and great.</p>
            <p>And generally wee haue ſeene, thereof the ſame ſimples and herbes that wee haue in Fraunce, and of the like good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſauour and taſte. The people be very good archers, and of great ſtrength: Their bowe ſtringes are made of Leather, and their arrowes of Reedes which they doe head with the teeth of fiſhes. As we now demaunded of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land called Seuola, whereof ſome haue written not to bee farre from thence, and to bee ſituate within the lande,<note place="margin">Seuola within xx. daies trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by boate of the riuer of May.</note> and toward the Sea called the South Sea. They ſhewed vs by ſignes that which we vnderſtood well enough, that they might goe thither with their Boates (by riuers) in twentie dayes. They that haue written of this kingdome and towne of Seuola, and other townes and kingdomes thereaboutes, ſay, that there is great aboundance of golde and ſiluer, precious ſtones, and other great riches: and that the people had their arrowes headed (in ſteede of yron) with ſharpe pointed Turqueſſes. Thus the night appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, it was conuenient for vs to returne by day a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boorde. Wee tooke leaue of them muche to their griefe, but more to ours without compariſon, for that wee
<pb facs="tcp:6277:45"/> had no meane to enter the riuers with our ſhippe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, it was not their cuſtome eyther to eate or drinke from the Sunne riſing till his going downe: yet the king open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woulde needes drinke with vs, praying vs verie gently to giue him the cuppe whereout we had drunke: and ſo making him to vnderſtande that wee woulde ſee him againe the next day, we retired to our ſhippes, which lay aboue ſixe leagues from the hauen to the ſea.</p>
            <p>The next day in the morning we returned to land againe, accompanied with the Captaines, Gentlemen, and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and other of our ſmall trope: cariyng with vs a Pillour or columne of harde ſtone, our kings armes graued therein, to plant and ſet the ſame in the enterie of the Porte in ſome high place, where it might bee eaſely ſeene, and being come thither before the Indians were aſſembled, we eſpied on the ſouth ſyde of the Riuer a place very fitte for that purpoſe, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a litle hill, compaſſed with Cypres, Bayes, Paulmes and other trees, with ſweete ſmelling and pleaſant ſhrubbes. In the middle whereof we planted the firſt bound or limit of his Maieſtie. This done perceiuing our firſt Indians aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, not without ſome miſliking of thoſe on the South parte, where we had ſet the limitte, who taried for vs in the ſame place where they met with vs the day before, ſeeming vnto vs that there is ſome enimitie betweene them and the others. But when they perceyued our long tarying on this ſide, they ran to ſee what we had done in that place where we landed firſt, and had ſet our limitte: which they vewed a great while without touching it any way, or abaſſing, or euer ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to vs therof at any time after. Howebeit we could ſka<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t depart but as it were w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> griefe of minde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this our firſt alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they rowing vnto vs all along the riuer from all parts and preſenting vs with ſome of their harts ſkins, painted and vnpainted, meale, litle cakes, freſhe water, rootes like vnto Rinbabe which they haue in great eſtimation, and make ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a potion of medicine: alſo they brought litle bagges of redde colours and ſome ſmall ſpices like vnto Vire, percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:6277:46"/> among them ſelues fayre thinges painted as it had bin with graine of ſcarlet, ſhowing vnto vs by ſignes that they had in the lande golde and ſiluer and copper: whereof wee haue brought ſome,<note place="margin">Gold, ſiluer, and copper in Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. Turqueſſes and aboundance of pearles. Marſhes.</note> Alſo lead like vnto ours which we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Alſo turqueſſes and great aboundance of pearles whiche as they declared vnto vs they tooke out of oyſters, whereof there is taken euer along the riuer ſide, &amp; among the reedes, and in the marſhes: and ſo merueylous aboundance as is ſkant credible: and we haue perceiued that there be as many and as faire pearles found there as in any countrey of the worlde. For wee ſawe a man of theirs as we entered into our boates, that had a pearle hanging at a coller of golde and ſiluer about his necke,<note place="margin">Pearles as big as acornes.</note> as great as an Acorne at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt. This man as he had taken fiſhe in one of their fiſhing packs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by brought that ſame to our boates, and our men perceiuing the greatneſſe therof, one of them putting his finger toward it, the man drewe backe, and woulde no more come neare the boate: not for any feare that he had that they woulde haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Coller &amp; Pearle from him for he would haue giuen it them, for a looking glaſſe or a knife:</p>
            <p>But that hee doubted leſt they woulde haue pulled him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boate, &amp; ſo by force haue caried him away. He was one of the goodlieſt men of all the company. But for that we had no leaſure to tary any longer with them, the day being well paſſed, whiche greeued vs, for the commoditie and great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whiche as wee vnderſtoode and ſawe might bee gotten there, deſiring alſo to employ the reſt of the day with our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde aliance the Indians on the ſouthſide, as we perceiuer them the day before, which ſtill taried looking for vs: Wee paſſed the riuer to their ſhore, where as wee founde them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riyng for vs, quietly and in good order, with newe paintings vpon their face, and feathers vpon their heade: the King with his Bowe and Arrowes lying by him, ſate on the grounde ſtrawed with boughes betweene his two brethren, whiche were goodly men and well ſhapen and of a wonderfull ſhow of actiuities, hauing vpon their heades, one haire truſſed
<pb facs="tcp:6277:46"/> vpright of heyght, of ſome kinde of wild beaſt gathered and wrought together with great cunning, wrethed and faſted after the forme of a Diademe. One of them had hanging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke a rounde plate of redde copper well poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, with one other leſſer of Siluer in the middeſt of it, &amp; at his eare a litle plate of Copper wherewith they vſe to ſtripe the ſweat from their bodies. They ſhewed vs that there was greatſtore of this mettell within the countrey, about fiue or ſixe daies iourney from thence, both in the ſouthſide &amp; north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the ſame riuers, and that they went thither in their Boates. Which Boates they make but of one piece of a tree, woorking it whole ſo cunningly and featly, that they put in one of theſe boates fifteene or twentie perſons, and go their wayes very ſafely. They that rowe ſtande vpright ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their ores ſhort after the faſhion of a Peele. Thus being among them they preſented vs with meale dreſſed &amp; baked, very good &amp; wel taſted, and of good nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, alſo beanes, and fiſh, as crabbes, lobſtars, creuiſes, and many other kinde of good fiſhes, ſhewing vs by ſignes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their dwellings were farre off, and if their prouiſion had been neere hande, they woulde haue preſented vs with manye other refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges.</p>
            <p>The night nowe approching, we were faine to returne to our Shippe, very much to our griefe: for that wee durſte not hazarde to enter with our Shippe, by reaſon of a barre of lande, that was at the enterie of the Porte, howe be it, at a full Sea there is two fadome and a halfe of water at the leaſt, and it is but a leape ouer a ſurge to paſſe this Barre, not paſſing the length of two cables, and then forthwith e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where within ſixe or ſeuen fadome water. So that it maketh a very fayre hauen, and Shippes of a meane burden from foureſcore to a hundred tunnes may enter therein at all floodes, yea of a farre greater burthen, if there were French men dwelling there that might ſkoure the enterye as they doe in Fraunce: for there is nothing lacking for the lyfe of man. The ſituation is vnder the eleuation of xxx. degrees, a good climate healthfull, and of a good
<pb facs="tcp:6277:47"/> temperature, merueilous pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people good, &amp; of a good and amiable nature,<note place="margin">Gentlenes muſt be vſed towards them.</note> which willingly will obay: yea be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſerue thoſe that ſhall with gentlenes and humanitie goe about to allure them, as it is needful for thoſe that be ſent thither hereafter ſo to doe, and as I haue charged thoſe that be left there to do, to the ende they may aſke and learne of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where they take their gold, copper, and turqueſſes, and other thinges yet vnknowen vnto vs: by reaſon of the time we ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned there. For if any rude or rigorous meanes ſhould be vſed towards this people, they woulde flie hither and thither through the Woods and Foreſts, and abandon their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and countreys.</p>
            <p>The next day being the thirde day of May, deſiring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to finde out harbours to reſt in, we ſet vp ſaile againe: And after we had raunged the coaſt as neere the ſhore as we could, there appeared vnto vs about ſeuen leagues of on this ſide of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuer of May a great opening or Bay of ſome riuer, whither with one of our boates we rowed, &amp; there found one entrie almoſt like y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the riuer of May, and within the ſame as great a depth, and as large a diuiding it ſelfe into many great ſtreames, great and broade ſtretchinges towardes the high lande, with many other leſſe, that diuide the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey into faire and great landes and great number of ſmall and fayre Medowes. Being entred into them about three leagues, wee found in a place very commodious, ſtrong, and pleaſant of ſituation, certayne Indians, who receiued vs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gently: Howe be it, we being ſomewhat neare their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it ſeemed it was ſomewhat againſt their good willes that we went thither, for at their cries and noyſes they made their wiues and children and hoſhoulde ſtuffe to be caried into the Woods: Howe be it they ſuffered vs to goe into their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but they themſelues woulde not accompany vs thither. Their houſes bee made of Wood fitly and cloſe, ſet vpright and couered with Reedes: the moſt part of them after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a pauilion. But there was one houſe amongeſt the reſt verie long and broade, with ſettles rounde about made
<pb facs="tcp:6277:47"/> of Reedes trimly couched together, which ſerue them both for beddes and ſeates, they be of height two foote from the grounde, ſet vpon great rounde pillers painted with red, ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, and blewe, well and trimlie poliſhed: ſome ſorte of this people perceiuing that we had in no maner wiſe hurted their dwellings nor gardens whiche they dreſſed very diligently, they returned all vnto vs before our inbarking, ſeeming very well contented by their giuing vnto vs water, fruites, and Hart ſkinnes. It is a place wonderfull fertill, and of ſtrong ſituatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the ground fat, ſo that it is likely that it would bring forth Wheate and all other corne twiſe a yeere,<note place="margin">Great fertilitie.</note> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities for liuelihood, and the hope of more riches, bee like vnto thoſe we found and conſidered vpon the riuer of May, without comming into the ſea: this arme doth diuide, and maketh many other Iles of May, as alſo many other great Ilandes: by the which wee trauell from one Ilande to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, betweene lande and land.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And it ſeemeth that men may ſayle without danger through al the countrey, and neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the great ſea, which were a wonderfull aduantage.</p>
            <p>This is the lande of Checere whereof ſome haue written, &amp; which many haue gone about to find out, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great riches they perceiued by ſome Indians to be founde there. It is ſet vnder ſo good a climate, that none of our men (though wee were there in the hoteſt time of the yeere, the ſunne entring into Cancer) were troubled with any ſickneſſes. The people there liue long and in great health and ſtrength, ſo that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged men goe without ſlaues, and are able to goe and runne like the youngeſt of them, who onely are knowen to be olde by the wrinckles in their face, and decay of ſight. Wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them verie friendly, &amp; with their contentation. But the night ouertaking vs, we were conſtrayned to lye in our ſhips all that night, till it was day, floting vpon this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which we haue called Sene,<note place="margin">The riuer of Sene.</note> becauſe that the entery of it is as broade as from hauer degrace vnto Honeſleue. At the breake of the day wee eſpied out of the South ſyde one of the fayreſt, pleaſaunteſt, and greateſt medowe grounde
<pb facs="tcp:6277:48"/> that might bee ſeene, into the which wee went, finding at the very entrie a long, faire, and great Lake, and an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of footeſteps of great Hartes and Hindes of a wonderfull greatneſſe,<note place="margin">Heardes of tame Hartes.</note> the ſteppes beeing all freſh and new, and it ſeemeth that the people doe nouriſhe them like tame Cattell in great heards: for we ſaw the ſteppes of an Indian that folowed them.</p>
            <p>The Chanell and depth of this riuer of Seyne, is one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſide of the medowe that is in the Ile of May. Being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our ſhips, we ſayled to knowe more and more of this coaſt, goying as neere the ſhore as we coulde. And as wee had ſayled about ſixe or ſeuen leagues, there appeared vnto us another Bay, where we caſt anker, and tarrying ſo all the night, in the morning wee went thither, and finding (by our founding) at the entrie many bankes and beatings, we durſt not enter there with our great ſhip, hauing named the riuer Somme, which is 8. 9. 10. 11. fadome depth, diuiding it ſelfe into many great Ilands, and ſmall goodly medow grounds and paſtures, and euery where ſuch abundance of fiſh as is incredible, and on the Weaſt Northweſt ſide, there is a great riuer that commeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the countrie of a great length ouer: and another on the Northeaſt ſide, which returne into the Sea. So that (my Lord) it is a countrie full of hauens, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,<note place="margin">Good hauens and riuers.</note> and Ilands, of ſuch fruitfulnes as cannot with tongue be expreſſed: and where in ſhort time great and precious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities might bee found.<note place="margin">7. Great &amp; good riuers.</note> And beſides this wee diſcouered and found alſo vii. riuers more, as great and as good, cutting and diuiding the land into faire and great Ilands. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians inhabitants there be like in manners, &amp; the countrie in fertillitie apt and commodious throughout to beare &amp; bring foorth plentifully all that men would plant or ſowe vpon it. There bee euery where the higheſt and greateſt Firtrees y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can be ſeene, very well ſmelling, and where out might bee gathered (with cutting the only bark) as much Roſen, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, &amp; Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſence, as men would deſire. And to be ſhort there lacketh nothing. Wherefore being not able to enter &amp; lie with our great veſſels there, we could make no long abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb facs="tcp:6277:48"/> nor enter ſo farre into the riuers and countries as wee would faine haue done: for it is well knowne how many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences haue happened vnto men, not only in attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of newe diſcoueries, but alſo in all places by leauing their great veſſels in the Sea, farre from the land, vnfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of the heads and beſt men.

Alſo an innumerable ſort of wilde foule of all ſortes, and in little Ilandes at the entrie of this hauen, on the Eaſt North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt ſide, there is ſo great number of Egrepes that the buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes bee all white and couered with them, ſo that one may take of the young ones with his hande as many as hee will carry away. There bee alſo a number of other foules, as Hernes, Bitters, Curlues. And to bee ſhort, there is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmall byrdes that it is a ſtrange thing to bee ſeene. Wee founde the Indians there more doubtfull and fearefull then the others before: Yet after we had been in their houſes, and congregated with them, and ſhewed curteſie to thoſe that we founde to haue abandoned there through boats meale, victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and ſmall houſholde ſtuffe, and both in not taking awaye or touching any part thereof, and in leauing in that place where they dreſſed their meate, Kniues, Looking glaſſes, little Beades of glaſſe,<note place="margin">A ſpeciall note.</note> which they loue and eſteeme aboue golde and pearles, for to hang them at their eares and neck, and to giue them to their wiues and children: they were ſomewhat emboldened.</p>

Wherefore albeit, I was willing (according to your commaundement and memoriall) to bring away ſome of them with vs,<note place="margin">A commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> on the Princes behalfe and yours, I forbare to doe ſo for many conſiderations and reaſons that they told mee, and for that we were in doubt that (leauing ſome of our men there to inhabite) all the Countrie, men, women, and children, woulde not haue ceaſed to purſue them for to haue theirs againe: ſeeing they bee not able to conſider and way to what entent wee ſhoulde haue carried them away: &amp; this may bee better doone to their contentation, when they haue better acquaintance of vs, and know that there is no ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:6277:49"/> crueltie in vs, as in other people and nations, of whom they haue beene beguiled vnder colour of good faith: whiche do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ende turned to the doers no good.

            <p>The twentie of May wee planted another columne or pillor grauen with the kinges armes on the South ſide, in a high place, of the entrie of a great riuer, which wee called Libourne: where there is a lake of freſh water very good, and on the ſame ſide a little lower towards the entrie of the Hauen is one of the fayreſt fountaines that a man may drink of, which falleth by violence down to the riuer from an high place out of a red and ſandy ground, and yet for all that fruitefull and of good ayre, where it ſhoulde ſeeme that the Indians haue had ſome faire habitation.</p>

For ſo may you beſt diſcouer al the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall commodities of their countrey, and alſo all their wantes, all their ſtrengthes, all their weakeneſſe, and with whome they are in warre, and with whome confiderate in peace and amitie, &amp;c. whiche knowen, you may woorke many great effectes of greateſt conſequence.</p>
            <p>And in your planting the conſideration of the climate and of the ſoyle bee matters that are to bee reſpected. For if it be ſo that you may let in the ſalt ſea water, not mixed with the freſh into flattes, where the ſunne is of the heate that it is at Rochell, in the Bay of portingall, or in Spaine, then may you procure a man of ſkill, and ſo you haue wonne one noble commoditie for the fiſhing, and for trade of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize by making of Salt.</p>
            <p>Or if the ſoyle and clymate bee ſuch as may yeelde you the Grape as good as that at Burdeus, as that in Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, or as that about Siui in Spaine, or that in the Ilands of the Canaries, then there reſteth but a woorkeman to put in execution to make wines, and to dreſſe Reſings of the ſunne and other, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Or if you finde a ſoyle of the temperature of the South part of Spaine or Barbarie, in whiche you finde the Olif tree to growe: Then you may bee aſſured of a noble mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize for this realme, conſidering that our great trade of clothing doth require oyle, and weying howe deere of late it is become by the vent they haue of that commoditie in the Weſt Indies, and if you finde the wilde olif there it may be graffed.</p>
            <p>Or if you can finde the berrie of Cochenile with whiche wee colour Stammelles, or any Roote, Berrie, Fruite, wood or earth fitte for dying, you winne a notable thing fitt
<pb facs="tcp:6277:59"/> for our ſtate of clothing. This Cochenile is naturall in the weſt Indies on that firme.</p>
            <p>Or if you haue hides of beaſtes fit for ſole Lether, &amp;c. It wilbe a marchandize right good, and the ſauages there yet can not canne Lether after our kinde, yet excellently after their owne maner.</p>
            <p>Or if the ſoyle ſhall yeelde Figges, Almondes, Sugar Canes, Quinces, Orenges, Lemons, Potatos, &amp;c. there may ariſe ſome trade and trafficke, by figges, almonds, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, marmelade, Sucket &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Or if great woods bee founde, if they be of Cypres, cheſts may bee made, if they bee of ſome kinde of trees, pitche and tarre may be made, if they bee of ſome other then they may yeelde Roſin, Trupentine, &amp;c. and al for trade and trafficke, and Caſkes for wine and oyle may be made: likewiſe ſhips and houſes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And becauſe trafficke is a thing ſo materiall, I with that great obſeruation be taken what euery ſoyle yeeldeth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, in what commoditie ſoeuer, and what it may be made to yeeld by indeuour, and to ſend vs notice home, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon wee may deuiſe what meanes may be thought of to rayſe trades.</p>
            <p>Nowe admit that we might not be ſuffered by the ſauages to enioy any whole countrey or any more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcope of a Citie, yet if wee might enioy trafficke and be aſſured of the ſame, wee might bee much inriched, our Nauie might be increaſed, &amp; a place of ſafetie might there be found, if change of religion or ciuill warres ſhoulde happen in this realme, which are thinges of great benefite. But if we may inioy any large Territorie of apt ſoyle, we might ſo vſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as we ſhould not depende vpon Spaine for oyles, ſacks, reſinges, orenges, lemons, Spaniſh ſkinnes, &amp;c. Nor vppon Fraunce for wood, bayſalt, and gaſcoyne wines, nor on Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande for flaxe, pitch, tarre, maſtes, &amp;c. So we ſhoulde not ſo exhauſt our treaſure, and ſo exceedingly inriche our doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friendes, as we doe, but ſhoulde purchaſſe the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that we want for halfe the treaſure that now we do: but
<pb facs="tcp:6277:59"/> ſhould by our own induſtries &amp; the benefits of the ſoile there cheapely purches oyles, wines, ſalt, fruits, pitch, tarre, flaxe, hempe, maſtes, boordes, fiſhe, gold, ſiluer, copper, tallowe, hides and many commodities: beſides if there be no flates to make ſalt on, if you haue plentie of wood you may make it in ſufficient quantitie for common vſes at home there.</p>
            <p>If you can keepe a ſafe hauen, although you haue not the friendſhip of the neere neyghbours, yet you may haue traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke by ſea vpon one ſhore or other, vpon that firme in time to come, if not preſent.</p>
            <p>If you finde great plenty of tymber on the ſhore ſide or vpon any portable riuer, you were beſt to cut downe of the ſame the firſt wynter, to bee ſeaſoned for ſhippes, barkes, botes and houſes.</p>
            <p>And if neere ſuch wood there be any riuer or brooke vpon the which a ſawing mill may be placed, it woulde doe great ſeruice, and therefore conſideration woulde bee had of ſuche place.</p>
            <p>And if ſuch port &amp; choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place of ſetling were in poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; after fortified by art, although by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land ſide our Engliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were kept in, and might not inioy any traffick with the next neighbours, nor any vittel: yet might they vittel themſelues of fiſhe to ſerue verie neceſſitie, and enter into amitie with the enemies of their next neighbours, &amp; ſo haue vent of their marchandize of England and alſo haue vittel, or by meanes herevpon to be vſed to force the next neighbours to amitie. And keeping a nauie at the ſetling place, they ſhoulde finde out along the tracte of the lande to haue trafficke, and at diuers Ilandes alſo. And ſo this firſt ſeate might in time become a ſtapling place of the commodities of many countreys and territories, and in tyme this place myght be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all the prouinces round about the only gouernour. And if the place firſt choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould not ſo wel pleaſe our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as ſome other more lately founde out: There might bee an eaſie remoue, and that might be raſed, or rather kept for others of our nation to auoyde an ill neyghbour, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If the ſoyles adioyning to ſuch conuenient hauen and
<pb facs="tcp:6277:60"/> ſetling places be founde marſhie and boggie, then men ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in draining are to be caried thither. For arte may worke wonderfull effectes therein, and make the ſoyle rich for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vſes.</p>
            <p>To plante vppon an Ilande in the mouth of ſome nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riuer, or vpon the poynt of the lande entring into the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, if no ſuch Iland be, were to great ende. For if ſuch riuer were nauigable or portable farre into the lande, then would ariſe great hope of planting in fertill ſoyles, and trafficke on the one or on thother ſide of the riuer, or on both, or the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in amitie with one or other petie king conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding there for dominion.</p>
            <p>Such riuers founde, both barges and boates may bee made for the ſafe paſſage of ſuch as ſhal perce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. Theſe to bee couered with doubles of courſe linnen artificially wrought, to defend the arrow or the dart of the ſauage from the rower.</p>
            <p>Since euery ſoyle of the world by arte may be made to yeelde things to feede and to cloth man, bring in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne a perfect note of the ſoyle without and within, and we ſhall deuiſe if neede require to amende the ſame, &amp; to draw it to more perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if you finde not fruits in your plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting place to your liking, we ſhal in v. drifats furniſh you w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch kinds of plants to be caried thither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winter after your planting, as ſhall the very next ſummer folowing, yeeld you ſome fruite, and the yere next folowing, as much as ſhal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice a towne as big as Callice, and that ſhortly after ſhall be able to yeeld you great ſtore of ſtrong durable good ſider to drinke, &amp; theſe trees ſhalbe able to increaſe you within leſſe then vii. yeres as many trees preſently to beare, as may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the people of diuers pariſhes, which at the firſt ſetling may ſtand you in great ſteade, if the ſoyle haue not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of fruites of goodneſſe already. And becauſe you ought greedily to hunt after thinges that yeelde preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, without trouble of cariage thither, therefore I make mencion of theſe, thus ſpecially, to the ende you may haue it ſpecially in mynde.</p>
